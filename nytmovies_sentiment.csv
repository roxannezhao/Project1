The younger pair, high school students at their prom, aren¡¯t a couple at all when the story begins, though they have known each other for years. Bea (Isabelle Fuhrman) has been dumped by her date. Andy (Kyle Allen) is indifferently taking pictures for the yearbook. Their mutual prom-night misery brings them together.Their paths occasionally cross with Elizabeth (Anna Camp) and Drew (Justin Chatwin), a couple in their 30s who are wondering if their relationship has hit an endpoint. Of the two pairs, this one is the least well developed, and sometimes the back and forth between Elizabeth and Drew seems to be out of some generic-argument handbook.Ms. Baig, though, does have some place she¡¯s trying to get to, and in short order she arrives there.

Mr. Creed-Miles gives his character a convincing sense of being overwhelmed by the world, a defeatism that George¡¯s wife, Kathy (Kierston Wareing), tries to help him overcome.

Focusing instead on how time and distance can calm the heart and clear the mind, this small, intimate story highlights the relationships that drive Nelson¡¯s response when he¡¯s threatened by the fallout from a long-ago crime. His closest friends, unwilling to disrupt the neighborhood peace, warily decline to take sides in the approaching showdown; his sister (an impassioned Elizabeth Rodriguez) and his girlfriend (Shirley Rumierk) urge him to flee.

Bucolic flashbacks to lakeside picnics, where ripe young women vie for Elser¡¯s floppy-haired attentions and accordion serenades, reveal little about his beliefs or ambitions. Neither does his awkward incursion into the dismal marriage of his lover (Katharina Sch¨¹ttler) and her sozzled husband.As it happens, the movie¡¯s most compelling interaction is between Elser and a cautious police chief played by the admirable Burghart Klaussner, who achieves more with pursed lips and lowered eyelids than most actors manage with a page of dialogue. It¡¯s a performance that leaves space for nuanced interpretation ¡ª something that the rest of this overly conventional picture sorely lacks.

The wedding itself seems like a shaky affair, with an uneasy groom and a bride whose previous fianc¨¦ is still hovering.Ferenc Torok¡¯s lean, suggestive Hungarian feature, ¡°1945,¡± shot in gorgeous, high-contrast black-and-white, is a Holocaust film built, consciously or not, on a reversal of the tropes of the western, down to ticking clocks that might as well be nearing high noon.

It opens in 1979, when cool kids danced to Talking Heads (¡°This ain¡¯t no party, this ain¡¯t no disco¡±) and President Carter bummed everyone out talking about our ¡°crisis of confidence.¡± There¡¯s something in the air ¡ª or so it seems, although the California light here tends to blot out the shadows. When a car bursts into flames soon after the movie opens, it looks about as threatening as an art installation. Apocalypse later, man.The car belongs to Dorothea Fields ¡ª a thrilling Annette Bening ¡ª a divorced single mom with an only son, the teenage Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann, in a heartbreakingly sincere turn). Mother and child live in Santa Barbara, that drowsy, well-heeled coastal city north of Los Angeles. There, Dorothea is raising Jamie in a roomy, stately 1905 fixer-upper that she¡¯s renovating with the help of a boarder, William (Billy Crudup). Another lodger, an artist, Abbie (Greta Gerwig), helps keep their communal life jumping, as does Jamie¡¯s friend Julie (Elle Fanning), who likes to cuddle platonically with him at night, sharing secrets as he tries to keep his hormones and body from betraying him. The writer-director Mike Mills¡¯s last movie, ¡°Beginners,¡± was a lightly comic, fictionalized weepie about his father, who came out of the closet in his mid-70s when his son was an adult. Now Mr. Mills has turned to his mother, in another fictionalized story, moistened with tears, that draws on his life. This time, though, he has turned back the clock for a portrait of his mother as she was when he was a teenager and didn¡¯t yet entirely grasp her extraordinariness. Whether she was as remarkable as the woman onscreen seems entirely beside the point ¡ª ¡°20th Century Women¡± is a memory movie, one in which people are conjured up to bump against the larger world, exuberantly and uneasily. The personal is the political, as second-wave feminists liked to say, and so it is in ¡°20th Century Women.¡± The politics sneak up on you, filtered through the intimate lives of its electrically alive characters. Jamie is the story¡¯s hub, the center from which everything and everyone ostensibly radiates, but Dorothea is its reason for being. She sets the pieces into place and motion; she¡¯s the inspiration and guiding spirit, the story¡¯s balm and soul. She¡¯s also the one who, after Jamie lands in the hospital after a heart-leaping, foolish stunt, enlists Abbie and Julie to help raise Jamie. Dorothea¡¯s a with-it mom, from tousled hair to Birkenstocked toe, but she¡¯s also unsettled by the world.Abbie and Julie assume their responsibilities seriously. Julie, who smokes like a Frenchwoman and reads Judy Blume, shares battle stories and wounds from the sexual front. Abbie gives Jamie records and books, including ¡°Our Bodies, Ourselves,¡± that liberatory classic about women¡¯s health and sexuality. It¡¯s as eye-opening for Jamie as ¡°Sisterhood Is Powerful,¡± the radical feminist anthology that he first opens with almost spiritual reverence ¡ª or is it trepidation? (Later, when he explains the female orgasm to an acquaintance, one of those playground braggarts, the other guy pummels him.) Jamie¡¯s sentimental education is also a kind of encounter session. It¡¯s a witty and loose coalition of like minds, complete with skateboarding, dancing, loving and lived-in talk. A lot of that chatter is humorous ¡ª often gentle and wry, on rare occasion uproarious ¡ª but there¡¯s also a powerful undertow of loss running through the movie. There are sorrows and tragedies, one involving a story thread that allows Ms. Gerwig to root around in grief and a scene in which she uncomfortably, hilariously, clears the room. For her part, Ms. Fanning drifts in and out like a dream (Jamie¡¯s and Mr. Mills¡¯s), a magnificent emissary from that seductive land called Young and Beautiful. You simultaneously see the girl Julie is and the girl that she¡¯s on the verge of leaving behind.For a memoirist, Mr. Mills is uncommonly generous. Abbie, Julie and William, who sexily floats around the periphery (Mr. Crudup is superb at not quite stealing his scenes), are so persuasively detailed that all three could spin off into a separate movie; each has both sting and tenderness nearing grace. Yet these three and even Jamie pale next to Dorothea, who¡¯s satisfyingly complex, especially for a movie mother. Dorothea is at once laid back and uptight, which Ms. Bening conveys with moments of shambling, gestural looseness and sudden emotional spikiness. She floods the screen with warmth, threatens to burn the joint down and, with Mr. Mills, turns contradictions into character. Mr. Mills roots around Dorothea¡¯s unease but never quite figures it or her out, which deepens the movie. People are mysterious and parents are too, partly because you never really catch up to them. So you take stock, stare at family photographs and sift through mementos. Mr. Mills does something similar narratively as he samples the era¡¯s music, signposts and shards, all while circling Dorothea. Fittingly, given the title, in ¡°20th Century Women,¡± he also situates her in history. (The character is named after the photographer Dorothea Lange.) ¡°My mom was born in 1924,¡± Jamie says in voice-over early, as the screen fills with black-and-white footage of period despair. Those ghostly images stick with you, even after the story lightens. Mr. Mills has worked in graphic design and as a music-video director, and while setting up the story he folds in snapshot-like scenes from Jamie and Dorothea¡¯s origin stories, from a ravishing oceanic opening shot to her Depression roots, him as a grasping newborn infant and Gerald Ford stumbling. There¡¯s a kind of restlessness in the way these images pile up, to the movie¡¯s accumulation of album covers, its books, snatches of jazz and glimpses of Humphrey Bogart making love to Ingrid Bergman. It¡¯s as if Mr. Mills were riffling through an encyclopedia, searching for the perfect entry, which he¡¯s creating before your eyes.",0.999906952355292,"Comedy"

He then leaves Paul¡¯s Paris apartment and drives an Alfa Romeo into rural France. The fantasy of walking out on your life and aimlessly wandering around can beguile even the most contentedly domesticated among us.Pierre is also looking to quench a thirst. He regularly checks his Grindr app, and at a roadside restroom, scans the stall graffiti and calls a number advertising sex services. He also picks up people along the roadside, not for cruising purposes, but to be of help. The first is a middle-age woman who is booked to sing at a senior home. The characters encountered are a bit more colorful than the ones you are likely to come across in real life, but not so much that they seem overtly allegorical. As Pierre roams, Paul embarks on a quest of his own, traveling to the center of the country to look for his lover via concentric Grindr circles.Some of this story is mildly whimsical, and there are ramps into some kind of magical realism (a blizzard at the French-Italian border is a little far-fetched). There are a lot of shots from behind a car windshield. These are more allied with Vincent Gallo¡¯s ¡°The Brown Bunny¡± than with Monte Hellman¡¯s more lyrical ¡°Two-Lane Blacktop.¡± While Mr. Reybaud has exemplary artistic confidence and an interesting vision, this is a movie that in many ways defines or justifies the ¡°not for everybody¡± critical hedge.",0.538835086087563,"Comedy"

He credited the student with having given him a fresh eye on a film he thought he knew backward and forward.One testament to the infinite richness of Hitchcock¡¯s 1960 masterpiece is that it can sustain a film like Alexandre O. Philippe¡¯s documentary ¡°78/52: Hitchcock¡¯s Shower Scene.¡± Although ¡°78/52¡± discusses the significance of ¡°Psycho¡± as a whole, Mr. Philippe¡¯s movie is primarily devoted to a close reading of just one sequence: the 78 camera setups and 52 edits that yielded the sudden, violent, waterlogged demise of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Even moviegoers who know ¡°Psycho¡± backward and forward ¡ª who consider it a sacred text and who have read Stephen Rebello¡¯s excellent book ¡°Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ¡®Psycho¡¯¡± ¡ª are bound to learn something new from the movie, which addresses the shower scene from critical, historical, theoretical and technical angles, down to the blinding white of the bathroom tiles.Many of the original cast and crew members are no longer alive and are featured only in archival interviews, although seeing Marli Renfro, the pinup model who served as Janet Leigh¡¯s body double, is a special treat. Much of the movie¡¯s appeal lies in the more off-kilter observations: The curator Timothy Standring discusses the particular version of ¡°Susanna and the Elders¡± that hangs over Norman Bates¡¯s peephole and notes that, of all the renditions of that scene, the one Hitchcock used strongly connotes voyeurism.

Ever since the screening, I¡¯ve been wondering about those slithery creatures, which you may have noticed in the trailers and the posters, where a bunch of them share a bathtub with Mia Goth, one of the movie¡¯s stars.Not wondering in the ¡°What does it mean?¡± sense, mind you. Anyone who has even a slight acquaintance with Freudian theory or Japanese erotica will grasp the psychosexual significance of those eels, who live in the aquifer underneath an Alpine spa and occasionally make their way into the plumbing and beyond. My questions are of a more basic nature: How did they get down there in the first place? Are they an invasive species or part of the native ecosystem? What evolutionary process might account for their curiously symbiotic relationship with the spa¡¯s human residents?It would be unfair to blame the director, Gore Verbinski, or the screenwriter, Justin Haythe, for declining to provide a thorough explanation. ¡°A Cure for Wellness¡± defiantly and splendidly flouts the tenets of plausibility and coherence, which have never interested Mr. Verbinski very much. His r¨¦sum¨¦, after all, includes ¡°The Lone Ranger¡± (also written by Mr. Haythe), ¡°Rango¡± and, most notably, the first three ¡°Pirates of the Caribbean¡± movies. He comes by his knack for enjoyable nonsense as honestly as his taste for aquatic fauna. The eels may be the key to the puzzle posed by his latest project, or they may be (forgive me) a red herring. Maybe it would be best to drop the piscatory metaphors altogether. ¡°A Cure for Wellness¡± is a lustrous box of genre candy, the self-revealing work of an auteur who has laid bare not so much his psyche as his online streaming queue. To watch this movie is, above all, to make a list of all the other movies it evokes, sometimes with a literalness that treads the boundary between homage and outright plagiarism. You will notice a lot of Martin Scorsese¡¯s ¡°Shutter Island¡± here, as a dogged young man (Dane DeHaan) makes his way through an asylum-like complex of buildings in search of answers, only to become ever more deeply ensnared in the place¡¯s sinister mysteries. You may also catch echoes of Paolo Sorrentino¡¯s ¡°Youth¡± in the mountain rest-cure setting, the weary disdain for modern life and the visual voluptuousness. Mr. Verbinski doesn¡¯t so much observe shiny surfaces and opulent furnishings as caress them, sending a frisson of visual delight through his camera as it glides down corridors and soars over wooded glades.There¡¯s a bit of Guillermo del Toro¡¯s ¡°Crimson Peak¡± in the exuberant gothic creepiness, especially as the plot moves from corporate thriller to psychological melodrama to full-on creep show, complete with incest, medical experiments and ghoulish aristocratic shenanigans. And while these recent movies are the most obvious and distracting influences, an intrepid viewer will pick up hints of Hitchcock and Kubrick (and also, but only at the very end, of Spielberg), of ¡°Suspiria¡± and Mario Bava.It¡¯s all in good fun, really, though two and a half hours may be more of this kind of fun than a body can stand. You might feel like you¡¯re in the company of a manic cinephile friend breathlessly recounting his favorite movie scenes in no particular order. You admire his devotion, his taste and his scholarship, but in the end the experience is probably more satisfying for him than it is for you.Still, the company isn¡¯t bad. Mr. DeHaan brings an air of curdled innocence that inspires an interesting ambivalence. You sort of root for his character, a Wall Street hotshot named Lockhart, but you also kind of hope he suffers, since he¡¯s a selfish, ill-mannered jerk. Dispatched by his bosses to retrieve an executive who has vanished in Switzerland, Lockhart, who is haunted by memories of his father¡¯s suicide, finds himself in the company and eventually the care of Dr. Volmer (Jason Isaacs), a suave Continental with unnervingly impeccable manners. Mr. Isaacs is the kind of silken, charismatic villain that you can¡¯t wait to see again. More plot summary would be an offense against Mr. Verbinski¡¯s demented inventiveness. Lockhart also encounters a curious elderly patient (Celia Imre), a heavy-eyed limo driver (Ivo Nandi), a tavern full of hostile young locals and a dreamy girl named Hannah (Ms. Goth, looking like a ¡¯70s fantasy hybrid of Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek). There are clues and false leads, shocking discoveries and bouts of talking-bad-guy exposition, narrow escapes and fights to the death. And those eels, of course. You¡¯ll figure it all out for yourself, or not. In any case, the moral of the story turns out to be a bit of advice often given to travelers: Don¡¯t drink the water.",0.989199518241163,"Mystery"

Virtually a chamber piece with just two primary characters, the movie dives into the black arts with methodical restraint and escalating unease.Unfolding almost entirely inside a remote house in the Welsh countryside, the story (also by Mr. Gavin) concerns a grieving mother named Sophia (a marvelous Catherine Walker). Sophia has paid a great deal of money to rent the neglected property. She has also hired a reluctant occultist, Joseph (Steve Oram, perfectly hostile), to guide her through a perilous, monthslong ritual that will allow her to speak with her dead son.Or will it? As motives shift and resolve weakens, the punishing purification rites and mental preparation begin to take their toll on characters whose flaws were already evident. Toadstools are eaten and blood is supped, but the procedures are neither particularly gory nor pornographically brutal. Focusing instead on psychological strain, Mr. Gavin, working with the cinematographer Cathal Watters, musters multiple shades of smoke and soot into a haunting evocation of a grief so disruptive it will rend the fabric between this world and the next.¡°A Dark Song¡± might be soaked in sorcery, but its true magic lies in its construction. Shot in just 20 days in and around Dublin, the movie has a spare, simple style and rhythms that mimic the characters¡¯ heartbeats: steady and strong; racing and faint; irregular and jumpy.

Bailey dies, as dogs do, yet keeps being reincarnated, as a different breed and sometimes a different sex.He has a few cute mannerisms and tricks that are consistent from life to life, which ultimately becomes tear-jerkingly important as he tries to find his way back to Ethan (Bryce Gheisar, K.

Along the way, though, he has various other owners, allowing the movie to indulge in assorted hero-dog fantasies. Save people from a burning house? Check.

But maybe the dead have feelings, too. That, when you think about it, is the premise of a great many ghost stories, and also of ¡°A Ghost Story,¡± David Lowery¡¯s ingenious and affecting new film.The specter whose story this is ¡ª let¡¯s call him Ghostie, since even when he¡¯s alive we never learn his name ¡ª indulges in some of the usual haunting behaviors. He knocks books off shelves, makes light bulbs flicker, opens closet doors in the middle of the night and subjects a terrified family to a full-scale, crockery-smashing supernatural tantrum.The effect of all of this on the viewer is strange and intense but not exactly scary in the expected horror-movie manner. In an age of expanded, digitally enabled ectoplasmic possibility, Mr. Lowery takes a tried-and-true, low-tech, Halloween-costume approach. Ghostie is a bedsheet with eyeholes. Possibly with some digital enhancement, but basically a 6-year-old¡¯s idea of a ghost. And why not? We intuit his moods through the drape and droop of the fabric (the thread count looks pretty decent), and infer a brooding, smoldering temperament behind the cloth. This may be because the person inside ¡ª or at least the person Ghostie used to be ¡ª is Casey Affleck.Before his transformation into the title character, Mr. Affleck and Rooney Mara ¡ª her character is also unnamed ¡ª live together in a ranch house in the middle of somewhere. They argue a little about moving, but otherwise they pursue a low-key, harmonious, semi-bohemian existence. He writes songs and experiments with sound. She goes off to work in the morning. They whisper and look gorgeous and occasionally exchange tender, tentative smiles. In some ways these two (and the other human beings who show up from time to time) are the real ghosts in the story ¡ª abstract, almost theoretical creatures floating in and out of Ghostie¡¯s troubled consciousness. The couple¡¯s brief time together sets a hushed, poignant tone and establishes the dramatic and emotional limits within which ¡°A Ghost Story¡± will operate. Not that there aren¡¯t jolts and surprises. Just when you think you¡¯ve cracked the film¡¯s circumscribed logic, it opens up and goes wild in ways at once too wondrous and too preposterous to spoil. As a metaphysician, Mr. Lowery is not hung up on rules, but as a storyteller and an orchestrator of emotional effects he appreciates the need for coherence.Ghostie is not the only one of his kind in the movie. The dead (at least some of them) can communicate directly with one another and passive aggressively with the living. They can travel in time but not in space, which explains the existence of haunted houses. They witness our suffering and fear but have only the most limited ability to intervene, even though they seem to inhabit, albeit invisibly, the same physical world we do. After a while, Ghostie¡¯s sheet starts looking rumpled and dirty. It¡¯s the only one he has, and he¡¯s been wearing it for a very long time.And time ¡ª the ways it can accelerate through years, freeze in moments and defy measurement altogether ¡ª is Mr. Lowery¡¯s chief preoccupation here, his major theme and his raw material. At one point, early in her bereavement, Ms. Mara comes home to find a pie left for her by a well-meaning acquaintance. As Ghostie looks on, she takes a few forkfuls and then slumps down against a cabinet and keeps eating, without haste but also without pausing for breath. The camera stays on her for several minutes, which feels like an eternity. Eternity, though, is poor Ghostie¡¯s problem.For him the calendar and the clock have no meaning, and as the film proceeds, growing darker and stranger, we feel his impatience and disorientation. What we don¡¯t feel is the boredom that must surely be part of the story of his long afterlife. ¡°A Ghost Story¡± is suspenseful, dourly funny and at times piercingly emotional. Daniel Hart¡¯s musical score is full of pathos and longing, compensating ¡ª maybe almost overcompensating ¡ª for the literal deadpan of the protagonist.The movie may be built around a conceptual gimmick, but it feels less self-conscious than Mr. Lowery¡¯s other recent films, the gloomy Southern crime story ¡°Ain¡¯t Them Bodies Saints¡± (also starring Mr. Affleck and Ms. Mara) and the sweet, borderline-twee remake of the ¡¯70s children¡¯s weepie ¡°Pete¡¯s Dragon.¡± ¡°A Ghost Story¡± works so well because it shouldn¡¯t work at all. Starting with a quote from Virginia Woolf, it wears its literary pedigree on its sleeve, yet it manages to feel fresh and inventive rather than stale or studied. It¡¯s like an old tale by Saki or Henry James read for the first time: hair-raising and clever, a tour de force of sensation and a triumph of craft. Movies these days are abuzz with all kinds of paranormal activity, most of it aimed at delivering easy, superficial terror. The scariest scene in ¡°A Ghost Story¡± may be the most human, when a random guy at a party won¡¯t stop talking about the meaningless of existence in an indifferent universe. Dude, we know! Shut up! Ghostie¡¯s silence at that moment speaks volumes, and his inscrutable presence is a reminder that fright may be an unjust, irrational response to him and his kind. We fear what we don¡¯t understand, and a ghost is only human, after all.",0.968943740288378,"Drama"

Whether it and the movie in general are too intense for younger children is something parents need to ask themselves. A PG-13 rating is sometimes an overreaction to a curse word or two, but here it¡¯s a useful caution.The central human character is a 12-year-old, Conor O¡¯Malley (Lewis MacDougall), who as the movie opens is having one heck of a nightmare: He and his mother (Felicity Jones) are in a churchyard as the ground begins collapsing around them, and she is in danger of being sucked away into an abyss. No subtlety or pussyfooting around here; we soon learn that the mother is fatally ill and in the midst of a drawn-out death.If the opening moments are striking, what comes next is even more so: Conor¡¯s imagination calls forth a monstrous yew tree that talks in the voice of Liam Neeson. It is one impressive cinematic creation, and it leads Conor on a journey intended to help him confront the realities he faces and his innermost thoughts about them.Those realities, by the way, do not merely involve his dying mother. He is being bullied at school. He has issues with his father (Toby Kebbell), who left the family years ago and started another far away. His grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) wants him to come live with her, but he finds her cold and off-putting. That¡¯s a lot to load onto one boy ¡ª too much, really.

At a church dance, Seretse, played by David Oyelowo, meets Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike). The two eye each other warily as the band bleats. He asks her if she likes jazz; she insists she does, only not as she¡¯s ever heard any British musicians play it. Soon they are swapping 78s by mail, and dating. One night he kneels to propose.There are, of course, complications. A good number of them are predictable, but they go deeper than a viewer unfamiliar with their story might have expected. Seretse¡¯s homeland, Bechuanaland (now Botswana), an African protectorate under British control, sits directly above South Africa, which in the late 1940s was instituting the murderous policy of apartheid. The British, therefore, were deeply invested in not alienating South Africa¡¯s rulers. And Seretse¡¯s uncle is not keen on the returning king bringing home a white queen.For all the tumult surrounding them, the couple remain the focus of the film. The director, Amma Asante (working from a script by Guy Hibbert, who adapted Susan Williams¡¯s 2006 nonfiction book ¡°Colour Bar¡±), emphasizes this in her staging of the unequivocal and unaffected affection and regard they exchange. Here, as with her 2014 feature, ¡°Belle,¡± Ms. Asante addresses contemporary concerns via period romance, and her commitment to the romance is not a feint. At one point the movie shows political unrest churning into violence, and juxtaposes that with a scene of the pregnant Ruth going into labor. Were you to bet that the movie would follow the childbirth thread, you would win.This is also a very polite film. When, in a moment of frustration, Seretse swipes his arm across his desktop, knocking papers off it, Ms. Asante cuts before a single sheet, or any other object, hits the floor. For all that, the movie depicts the appalling political gamesmanship that conspires to keep Seretse and Ruth apart (including, in a shocking twist, a betrayal by a historical figure who¡¯s almost exclusively lauded in pop-culture portrayals) with consistent clarity. And while her filmmaking style can sometimes come across as staid, her sense of pace is always acute.The best reason to see ¡°A United Kingdom,¡± however, is the performance by Mr. Oyelowo, who is also one of the film¡¯s producers.

Life was treacherous for Jews in Europe even after the war. Anti-Semitism remained virulent, and survivors journeyed long distances home only to find their possessions stolen. One woman recalls coming back and being threatened by strangers who had moved into her house and were wearing her clothes.All six eventually relocated to America, where they were bewildered by friends and relatives, who were loath to mention the camps.

Tall and lean, Mr. Abe has handsome features ¡ª floppy dark hair across his forehead, prominent cheekbones and a long jaw line. But here, playing Ryota Shinoda, a onetime literary sensation fallen on hard times professionally and personally, he also has lines around and bags under his eyes, a perpetual five o¡¯clock shadow and a downcast mouth. He looks as if he could be trouble.As it happens, he is trouble mostly for himself, although he manages to irritate his ex-wife, Kyoko (Yoko Maki), because of his inability to pay child support for their son, Shingo (Taiyo Yoshizawa), and frustrate his sister (Satomi Kobayashi), whom he hits up for money with grim regularity. Ryota, having never followed up on his award-winning first novel, now works as a private detective. (The novel is another thing his sister is annoyed about; ¡°Don¡¯t you dare write about us again,¡± she snaps at one point.) It¡¯s a gig that gives him many opportunities to alter the calibration of his moral compass ¡ª in one scene he tries to talk a subject of an investigation into buying the evidence he¡¯s gathered against her. He also spies on his ex-wife, and is less than thrilled to learn that her unctuous new boyfriend has bought Shingo a snazzy baseball mitt.Ryota¡¯s aging mother, Yoshiko (Kirin Kiki), loves him unconditionally, though, and she doesn¡¯t give him a hard time when she walks in after he¡¯s clearly been rifling through her apartment, trying to find a family heirloom to pawn. She lives alone (the family¡¯s patriarch has died, presumably recently) in a Tokyo apartment complex far removed from the bustling city we are accustomed to seeing in Japanese films, or films about Japan. The neighborhood isn¡¯t showy, but it¡¯s a pleasant, relatively tree-lined environment, and its older residents get together in informal groups to listen to and discuss Beethoven. Nevertheless, Yoshiko is a little preoccupied with what she sees as the approaching end of her life.As Ryota scrambles to somehow get ahead, Kyoko seems befuddled by her own resentments and prospects for the future. Meanwhile, the young Shingo bristles at a potential stepfather who offers baseball coaching along the lines of ¡°To be the hero, you have to get a hit¡± even though the situation under consideration calls for drawing a walk.

Mr. Kore-eda, whose most noteworthy family dramas include ¡°Still Walking¡± (2009) and ¡°Like Father, Like Son¡± (2014), works in a quiet cinematic register, and the slightest error in tone could upend the whole enterprise.

So much has changed in the world, and in movies, since the first ¡°Alien¡± freaked out audiences in 1979, that the appearance of a chittering, scurrying, fast-spawning extraterrestrial predator feels like a visit from an old friend. Humanity may have lapsed into terminal tedium or hubristic stupidity, but that creature, with long, slender limbs and a cranium like a speedskater¡¯s helmet, remains interesting.The same can be said about ¡°Alien: Covenant,¡± which follows  ¡°Prometheus¡± in Ridley Scott¡¯s 21st-century refurbishing of the franchise he initiated (with the crucial contributions of Sigourney Weaver and the graphic artist H. R. Giger) almost 40 years ago. It¡¯s an interesting movie. I wish I could be more effusive, but ¡°Covenant,¡± for all its interplanetary ranging, commits itself above all to the canny management of expectations. To complain about its lack of ambition would be to misconstrue its intentions. Rather than setting out to conquer new worlds or excavate primal fears, this ¡°Alien¡± is content to uphold a long-lived and well-regarded brand. Correcting some of the previous film¡¯s mistakes ¡ª not enough alien! too much mythological mumbo-jumbo best left to movies with ¡°Star¡± in the title! ¡ª Mr. Scott parcels out carefully measured portions of awe, wonder and terror on the established installment plan. This episode needs to satisfy you just enough to make sure you come back for the next one. The story begins 10 years after the events of ¡°Prometheus¡± and ends en route to a sequel that will bring us closer to the beginning of the cycle. (Arranging installments in sequential order is a totally old-fashioned, linear, 20th-century way of doing business.) As usual, a starship is plying the far reaches of space. As usual, the crew is a collection of talented actors obeying the imperatives of science-fiction seriousness. There are a bunch of married couples ¡ª James Franco and Katherine Waterston; Danny McBride and Amy Seimetz; Demi¨¢n Bichir and Nathaniel Dean; Billy Crudup and Carmen Ejogo ¡ª and others with enough personality to make us feel a little something when they die. Most of them do. Mr. Franco¡¯s character, the captain of the Covenant, is a goner at the outset, reanimated in videos that stir his widow¡¯s grief. The first mate (Mr. Crudup) assumes command and leads his subordinates onto the surface of the green but curiously lifeless planet, the exact spot where some of the Prometheus crew members ended up. There they meet a robot named David, who invites some of the astronauts back to his cave to look at his etchings.David ¡ª seen in ¡°Prometheus¡± and in a Kubrick-esque prologue here ¡ª is played by Michael Fassbender. So is another robot named Walter, a slightly updated model from the Weyland corporation. The differences between the two machines are striking. Walter wears his hair parted on the side and has been engineered to speak like someone from Wisconsin. (How does Mr. Fassbender do it?)ImageMichael Fassbender plays a robot in ¡°Alien: Covenant.¡±Credit20th Century FoxDavid, in contrast, has a crisp British accent and an acquaintance with human culture that extends to Wagner and Michelangelo but is a bit wobbly on romantic poetry. Viewers who stayed awake through freshman English or the fifth season of ¡°Breaking Bad¡± know full well that Byron didn¡¯t write ¡°Ozymandias.¡± I¡¯m telling you this so you aren¡¯t fooled (as I confess I was) into spending a few minutes feeling smarter than the screenwriters, John Logan and Dante Harper. I don¡¯t think that counts as a spoiler. And Mr. Scott is, in any case, a nearly spoiler-proof filmmaker. Even his lesser efforts are infused with enough craft and energy to keep you engaged and surprised, and ¡°Alien: Covenant¡± is no exception. The gloom and shadows of the inhospitable planet and the hushed, antiseptic corridors of the Covenant are superior horror-movie environments, and the fact that you know more or less exactly what¡¯s coming doesn¡¯t diminish the creepiness, or lessen the jolt when the thing you¡¯re dreading arrives.David, it turns out, has devoted the years since ¡°Prometheus¡± to the study and cultivation of our beloved alien, while also harboring a grudge against the species that created him. Walter, in contrast, is more of a humanist, and the quarrel between them is not unlike the one between Magneto and Professor X in the ¡°X-Men¡± movies (speaking of Michael Fassbender) or Koba and Caesar in ¡°Dawn of the Planet of the Apes¡± (speaking of posthumous James Franco). I will leave it to you to decide who has the better argument, and who deserves to prevail.The answer, in any case, can only be the Giger alien itself, a contribution to the pantheon of modern design up there with the Coca-Cola logo and the Nike swoosh.

Viewers are also reminded that Shakur was only 25 when he died in September 1996 after being fatally injured in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. His killing has never been solved.From the opening, Mr. Boom¡¯s direction is uniformly uninspired: A reporter¡¯s prison interview with Shakur frames the movie¡¯s first half, and Mr. Boom blocks and shoots his scenes with dismal stolidness. Few sequences last longer than a couple of minutes; the movie plods along with a ¡°and then this happened¡± dutifulness, occasionally cutting back to the prison interview to have the reporter ask a pointed question or two. This almost invariably allows the film to excuse Shakur for bad actions that the reporter brings up during the interview.

In July 1973, John Paul Getty III (known as Paul), the elder Getty¡¯s 16-year-old grandson, was snatched off a street in Rome. His kidnappers demanded $17 million in ransom, telling Paul¡¯s mother, ¡°Get it from London.¡± It was a reference to Getty Sr., who in turn responded, ¡°If I pay one penny now, I¡¯ll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren,¡± a kiss-off heard around the world.Mr. Scott sets the scene quickly with a somewhat phantasmagoric meander through Rome¡¯s crowded streets. It¡¯s night, and pretty, boyish Paul (Charlie Plummer) is savoring la dolce vita, floating past the city¡¯s flesh and marble beauties and its swarms of catcalling, hustling paparazzi. There¡¯s sensuousness to Paul¡¯s drift, which, as the camera silkily slips alongside him, suggests a casual luxurious attitude toward life, of being free to do anything, go anywhere, say anything. He¡¯s kissed by fortune but also by youth. And when a streetwalker calls him baby and he smiles, you see just how young. Within seconds he¡¯s been kidnapped.¡°All the Money in the World¡± revs up beautifully, first as a thriller. But while the kidnapping is the movie¡¯s main event, it is only part of a story that is, by turns, a sordid, desperate and anguished tragedy about money. When Paul is kidnapped, Getty Sr. (Christopher Plummer) has already amassed a fortune, one partly pumped out of oil fields both in the United States and in the Middle East. (The Plummers are not related.) He lives alone in crepuscular gloom in Sutton Place, a manor house built by a favorite courtier of Henry VIII. There, amid miles of rooms adorned with gilt-framed masterworks, Getty Sr. closely monitors the stock information on the disgorging ticker tape that¡¯s both his leash and lifeline. Mr. Scott is a virtuoso of obsession, of men and women possessed. He likes darkness, pictorially and of the soul, and in Getty Sr. he has a magnificent specimen. And in Mr. Plummer he has a great actor giving a performance with a singular asterisk: In early November, with the movie already done, Mr. Scott hired Mr. Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. It was a bold move, an extreme variation on leaving a performance on the cutting-room floor. The 88-year-old Mr. Plummer isn¡¯t fully persuasive when briefly playing the younger Getty Sr., even in long shot. But his performance is so dominating, so magnetic and monstrous that it doesn¡¯t matter.Like many contemporary movies, this one kinks up its timeline. After Paul is kidnapped, the scene shifts to Saudi Arabia in 1948, where Getty Sr. is laying the foundation for an even greater fortune. Written by David Scarpa ¡ª working from John Pearson¡¯s 1995 book ¡°Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortune and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty¡± ¡ª the movie continues to jump around, filling in the back story while deepening the atmosphere and gathering the dramatis personae. One intimate scene takes place in the 1960s, where Paul¡¯s mother, Gail (Michelle Williams, warmth incarnate), and father, Getty Jr. (Andrew Buchan), are going broke with four boisterous young children.By the time Paul is kidnapped, his nuclear family has imploded; Getty Jr. is lost in an opium cloud and Gail is living in Rome. Much of the movie involves the drama of the kidnapping, which unfolds in separate, increasingly tightly woven-together lines of action. Taken by a ragtag criminal gang, Paul is stashed in a desolate farmhouse, where his closest keeper becomes Cinquanta (Romain Duris, a charismatically feral presence). In Rome, Gail struggles with the kidnappers, police and paparazzi while trying to interest Getty Sr. in his grandson. Getty Sr. continues counting out his money, only reluctantly calling in the cavalry, a security specialist, Fletcher (a very fine Mark Wahlberg).Mr. Scott conjures up entire worlds and sensibilities with visual precision, adding detail even when going for sweep. Each new scene adds another layer of meaning, thickening the slow-building sense of dread: the men in billowing white robes on oil-rich land waiting for Getty Sr., a master of the universe who arrives in a demonically belching train. Gail and Getty Jr., anxiously presenting their young family to Getty Sr. like paupers bowing down before the lord of the realm. As the story shifts from farmhouse to manor, from the kidnappers to Getty Sr. (each side armed, impatient, brutal), a parallelism develops and it becomes clear that he took his family hostage long before the kidnapping. Mr. Plummer can be an aloof, fairly cool screen presence and he chills Getty Sr. with cruel glints, funereal insinuation and a controlled, withholding physicality. A lot of actors soften their heavies, as if nervously asserting their own humanity. With Mr. Scott, Mr. Plummer instead creates a rapacious man whose hunger for wealth and power (and more money, always more) has hollowed him out and whose fatherly touch, at its most consuming, brings to mind Goya¡¯s painting of Saturn eating his son. The horror of Getty Sr. is that he is never less than human, but that he¡¯s hoarded everything, including every last vestige of love, for himself. It¡¯s a magnificent portrait of self-annihilation.At one point in the movie, Getty Sr. does pull out his wallet, buying a masterpiece while Paul continues to languish with his kidnappers, an ordeal that grows more frightening and byzantine as the clock winds down. Gail and Fletcher are struggling to free Paul, an effort that finds them often grappling with Getty Sr. His interest in Paul rises and falls, much like the stock market does. He has become famous for his status as the wealthiest man in the world, prominence that he clings to, much like his money. He has filled his manor house with priceless objects, turning statues and paintings into fetishes. He has earned so much, spent so much and, in doing so, insured that he and everyone else have lost.",0.992951402213922,"Biography"

We know his type pretty well. He possesses all the necessary skills but lacks the discipline that his employers supposedly demand. Conventional wisdom in his profession says that it¡¯s never personal, but for a guy like Rapp it¡¯s always personal. He may have a job to do, but he is also driven by longstanding grudges and unsettled scores. I¡¯m not saying he¡¯s a clich¨¦, but at the end of the day, it is what it is. The movie, directed by Michael Cuesta from a script by a team of blue-chip writers (Stephen Schiff and Michael Finch are credited, along with Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz), shows more skill than personality. There are fights and chases, punctuated by tense meetings and bouts of intense laptop and cellphone use. We hop from one camera-friendly hot spot to another before settling in Rome for the final round of fights and chases. Since this is in effect an origin story, a certain amount of time needs to be spent on explaining how Rapp arrived at his vocation and showing how he was trained in it. The explaining is perfunctory: Terrorists killed his fianc¨¦e on a beach in Ibiza the day he proposed to her.

There are also some perhaps not-fully-professional glances exchanged between Rapp and Annika (Shiva Negar), a colleague with a shadowy back story. In a Ludlumesque switcheroo, the geopolitical tensions are a bit of a red herring. The real enemy is a fellow known as Ghost (Taylor Kitsch), whose mentor Hurley used to be.It is personal, then.

But who¡¯s quibbling? This is, after all, a Hollywood fantasy starring Mr. Cruise as Barry Seal, a real-life smuggler. An enigma with multiple chins, Mr. Seal was apparently known as El Gordo (the Fat Man), a name he may have picked up while working for a drug cartel, the C.I.A. or the Drug Enforcement Administration.It can be hard to keep tabs on the movie¡¯s Barry, a pilot who racks up lots of miles while serving different masters. When the story opens, he is flying for T.W.A. and bored out of his evidently simple, rather dangerously restless mind. On the job, he amuses himself by flipping a few switches, jerking the controls and abruptly awakening sleeping passengers. His life takes a wild turn when a shady C.I.A. smiler, Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson), makes Barry an offer to help his country or something. Before long, Barry is cozying up to Pablo Escobar and smuggling cocaine and AK-47s across the Americas. Every so often, he drops into Panama to swap packages with that country¡¯s strongman, Manuel Noriega. This kind of secret world is familiar terrain for the director Doug Liman, who kick-started the ¡°Bourne¡± spy franchise and directed ¡°Fair Game,¡± a fictional take on some real-world intrigue involving Valerie Plame Wilson, a former C.I.A. officer, and her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, a onetime diplomat. ¡°American Made,¡± in its self-amused tone and skittering rhythms, though, is closer to the thriller ¡°Edge of Tomorrow,¡± Mr. Liman and Mr. Cruise¡¯s movie about a man ¡ª a wrong-guy, wrong-place type ¡ª who dies to live another day only to die (repeat). Mr. Liman likes playing with Mr. Cruise¡¯s persona, say, by messing up that famous smile, and he clearly likes letting his star strut and glide. Mr. Liman also likes stories about people with secret selves. Maybe it¡¯s an interest he picked up from his father, Arthur L. Liman, who was the chief counsel to the Senate committee during its 1987 Iran-contra investigation. The real Mr. Seal may have played a jaw-droppingly outlandish role in that notorious affair, which, among many other byzantine turns, involved the National Security Council funneling aid to the Nicaraguan contras. The scandal encompassed a vast cast of characters that included President Ronald Reagan and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. A few show up in ¡°American Made¡± either as fictionalized supporting characters or as themselves, smiling and slinking in archival images.Written by Gary Spinelli, ¡°American Made¡± goes down easily, especially if you don¡¯t let the historical record with its real-world stakes bother you. Mr. Cruise¡¯s brisk, ingratiating performance ¡ª all smiles, hard-charging physicality and beads of sweat ¡ª does a lot to soften the edges. But Mr. Liman doesn¡¯t press Mr. Cruise to dig into the character, and the actor mostly hurdles forward in a movie that never gets around to asking what makes Barry run and why. So Barry just runs and he flies and he flies some more, delivering coke and accumulating suitcases of cash that he buries and stashes in closets. (It¡¯s hard not to think that Mr. Cruise signed on to the movie so he could do all his own flying.) There¡¯s a lot going for ¡°American Made,¡± which spins like a top and has the visually beguiling, somewhat jaundiced look of a faded old Polaroid. So it¡¯s too bad that Mr. Liman himself didn¡¯t burrow in here as a filmmaker. The real Mr. Seal has been both the main and side attraction in many articles, books, documentaries and hard-core propaganda flicks, including some hinged on the Conspiratorial Industrial Complex which emerged during the Clinton presidency. Mr. Seal was also the subject of ¡°Doublecrossed,¡± a 1991 HBO docudrama starring Dennis Hopper (which is vaguely amusing if only because Mr. Hopper played a very different coke smuggler in ¡°Easy Rider¡±).¡°American Made¡± encourages and earns your laughter, although it also provokes skepticism, particularly in its attempt to portray Barry as a picaresque hero, one of those rogues tumbling and swaggering from adventure to adventure in a world that¡¯s more corrupt than they are. After all, it asks, how bad can Barry really be, especially given the company he keeps? He doesn¡¯t kill anyone, not exactly, and he¡¯s nice to his wife, Lucy (Sarah Wright Olsen), and their kids. A slightly downscale version of Margot Robbie¡¯s character in ¡°The Wolf of Wall Street,¡± Lucy has a few tangy moments, but she and the kids mostly enhance the visual design, much like the period cars and costumes. There are moments when it feels as if Mr. Liman¡¯s breakneck pacing is partly an attempt to distract us, to keep us from looking or thinking too hard about the grotesquely corrupt circus parading onscreen. Mr. Cruise¡¯s performance often seems similarly calculated. Barry likes to leap before he thinks: ¡°All this is legal?¡± he asks, scarcely pausing before plunging into the fray ¡ª and Mr. Cruise regularly widens his eyes in what seems to be an effort to convey Barry¡¯s incredulity. It¡¯s dissembling that is about as convincing as the Wolf leering in granny¡¯s nightie.

It already is one, in a manner of speaking, given that its strengths are lavishly violent, inventively choreographed fights that have been glued together by nonsense and Charlize Theron. The nonsense involves spies chasing secrets in Berlin just before the fall of the wall, which may suggest John le Carr¨¦ but plays closer to a dumb and dumber take on Boris and Natasha. Mostly, the movie is an excuse to watch a beautiful, deviously clever female avatar as she is stripped naked, dolled up and repeatedly beaten down only to rise again. This sort of spectacle ¡ª dress her up, dress her down, smack her around and wait for payback ¡ª isn¡¯t new, even if moviemakers like to insist otherwise. What¡¯s moderately different here is the sexed-up packaging of the violence in combination with Ms. Theron, who plays Lorraine Broughton, a spy in Her Majesty¡¯s Secret Service with a blond bob and a fondness for lethal heels. Like James Bond, Lorraine shoots to kill while remaining fabulously dressed to kill. This means she gets slammed around a lot, and takes almost as much punishment as she metes out. She¡¯s a punching bag, but she¡¯s also a fantasist¡¯s dream girl: the avenging goddess, destroyer of men.Lorraine gets plenty of opportunities to mix it up in Berlin, where the story soon turns into spy versus spy with washes of lurid color, topsy-turvy camerawork, loads of crashing cars and wall-to-wall pounding tunes. The airborne cars pirouette prettily, bashing and smashing with all the technological expertise production money can buy; the symphony of body blows, gun pops and crunching metal sounds fine and convincing. The tunes (¡°99 Luftballons¡±) basically just goose the violence and beg for laughs, having been chosen to elicit knowing smiles of recognition. At one point, James McAvoy sidles into the story looking all cool or something and wearing a smirk he needs to employ more cautiously. For her part, Ms. Theron looks hot and color coordinated, with black-and-white outfits that suit her character¡¯s ambiguity. Lorraine smokes and drinks and likes cold baths, preferably filled with ice cubes that do wonders for bruises and nipples. When she isn¡¯t moodily bathing or staring ¡ª into a mirror, the distance, what have you ¡ª she does a surprising amount of walking. She goes here, promenades there, strolling down halls and mean streets that the director David Leitch turns into fashion runways. She doesn¡¯t slip into rooms, she cat-walks, making entrances as if looking for trouble or paparazzi; it¡¯s no wonder someone says she isn¡¯t well disguised. Ms. Theron really is ready to play Bond. Written by Kurt Johnstad, ¡°Atomic Blonde¡± is based on ¡°The Coldest City,¡± a darkly shadowed, minimalist graphic novel written by Antony Johnston and illustrated by Sam Hart. As in the novel, the movie continually shifts between Berlin, where all the action happens, and an interrogation room in which Lorraine is being drilled by some intelligence types (John Goodman, Toby Jones). On the page, this bifurcation works, but on the screen it saps the story¡¯s momentum, partly because there¡¯s no violence in the room to distract from the genericism and puerility of the dialogue. At least in Berlin there are streets, beats and the sight of restlessly moving, twisting, slamming bodies.As she does, Ms. Theron locks down your attention immediately, holding you with her beauty and quiet vigilance. (She lets you see that she knows you¡¯re watching her.) Plenty of pretty people slide right off the screen. Ms. Theron, by contrast, holds you partly because she doesn¡¯t seem eager to let you in, keeping you curious as she keeps you at bay with reserve and sphinxlike smiles. This distance adds to her mystery and it also makes the eruptions of violence more electric. As ¡°Mad Max: Fury Road¡± confirmed, she¡¯s a natural warrior, but it¡¯s interesting here that each exertion and exhalation, each meaty, pulpy thump, also seems to be battering the fortifications that she has built around her.Mr. Leitch was one of the directors on ¡°John Wick,¡± a model of economic genre filmmaking, and he gives this movie¡¯s action scenes the same pummeling, visceral quality. Lorraine punches and is punched, and her body is soon mapped by bruises and abrasions. It¡¯s a lot of abuse for such puny returns, even if the fights are the best parts of ¡°Atomic Blonde.¡± Mr. Leitch understands the expressivity of hand-to-hand fights and he frames them accordingly, pushing in when it counts and pulling back to show entire bodies in whirling motion. The closeness underscores the intimacy of battle while the distance underlines the performative aspect, allowing you to see both the choreography and the violent beauty moving forward and backward one bloody step at a time.",0.975085837296537,"Action"

He wants it easy and breezy, although mostly he wants it cool, whether the latest means to his end, Baby (Ansel Elgort), is smooth-moving like Gene Kelly or burning rubber like Steve McQueen.A genre ride with a rebuilt engine and a sweet paint job, ¡°Baby Driver¡± is all about movement and sometimes stillness and how a beautiful man looks (feels, seems, is) even better when he¡¯s in glorious, syncopated, restless motion. The first time you see Baby ¡ª that¡¯s his handle, which suits Mr. Elgort, with his angelic face and young man¡¯s lissomeness ¡ª he¡¯s in the driver¡¯s seat, where he belongs. The car doesn¡¯t look like much, just a cherry-red box with doors and a spoiler. Like us, Baby is waiting for the action to start, seemingly sealed off from the outside world with his dark sunglasses and earbuds.This is how Baby rolls, with shifting gears, pumping feet and thumping tunes, and how Mr. Wright rolls here as well. There¡¯s a story, sure, about Baby getting in and out of trouble while finding love and money. He doesn¡¯t have much of an inner life, but he has skills, a heavy back story and a kindly foster father, Joe (CJ Jones, who helps give the movie its faint heartbeat), a deaf invalid with whom he signs. Baby also has tinnitus, which he quells with music; mostly, he has killer timing and gracefully elastic, reactive physicality that suggests Mr. Wright has put in time with the films of Jacques Tati. That¡¯s wonderful company to keep and to learn from, especially when you¡¯re as cleverly attentive a student as Mr. Wright. Baby drives hard, fast, tight and seemingly oh so effortlessly, spinning wheels across pavement like a Russian Olympian on ice. In the eye-tickling opener ¡ª a wham, bam, we¡¯ll-take-the-cash-ma¡¯am heist ¡ª Baby peels out in that red box (a souped-up Subaru) and motors into one of those warped Road Runner chases that builds momentum with near escapes, not-even-close winking and the twangy throbbing of ¡°Bellbottoms,¡± from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, a group once unforgettably described by the critic Robert Christgau as ¡°avant-travestying da blooze.¡± ¡°Baby Driver¡± isn¡¯t avant-travestying; it¡¯s a pop pastiche par excellence, crammed with cubistic action; glowering and golly-gee types (played by the seductive likes of Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Eiza Gonz¨¢lez and Lily James); and an encyclopedia of cinematic allusions, all basted in wall-to-wall tuneage. At times, the whole thing spins like a tribute album, a collection of covers of varying quality: diner yaks ¨¤ la Quentin Tarantino, Godardian splashes of color. When it works, the allusions give you a contact high, like when a friend turns you on to a favorite movie. At other times, Mr. Wright¡¯s pleasure veers into the self-satisfied, and all that love feels smothering, near-bullying, like bro-cinephilia in extremis.In the main, it¡¯s easy to go with Mr. Wright¡¯s flow, partly because he rarely steps off the gas. It¡¯s just go go go with an occasional stop for coffee or an amusingly testy sit-down with Baby¡¯s shadowy boss, Doc, one of those all-seeing, all-knowing criminal mystics whom Kevin Spacey gives ominous ooze and a daddy¡¯s mad (maybe nuts) indoor voice. Doc has something on Baby, who¡¯s been forced into a life of bad behavior and company. That Baby has had no choice but to drive along plays as knowingly implausible as it sounds. But heroic fatalism and unwilling villainy remain enduring cinematic tropes, including in gangster movies, even if it means holding convention over complexity.There¡¯s much to enjoy in ¡°Baby Driver,¡± including the satisfactions of genuine cinematic craft and technique, qualities that moviegoers can no longer take for granted. The edits snap, the colors pop and the cinematography serves the performances and the story rather than embalming them in an emptily showy, self-regarding directorial conceit. The emotions are mostly rote and cold, but the car chases are hot ¡ª at once fluid, geometric and rhythmic, with a beat Baby carries with him out of the car whether he¡¯s on the stroll or the run. (The director of photography is Bill Pope; the editors are Paul Machliss and Jonathan Amos; and the stunt coordinator is Darrin Prescott, leading an army.)¡°Baby Driver¡± is so good that you want it to be better and go deeper, for it to put down its guns (or at least hold them differently) and transcend its clich¨¦s and cine-quotes so it can rocket out of the genre safe box into the cosmic beyond where craft and technique transform into art. That¡¯s admittedly somewhat of a greedy complaint, particularly given how much Mr. Wright does right and that he clearly wants you levitating out of your seat. It¡¯s difficult to carp about a director who wants to please the audience this much (instead of, say, the franchise suits). At the same time, you have to wonder where Mr. Wright might go if he cut loose from his influences and let a little feeling muss up his form.",0.981442662609394,"Action"

(This is the best career Mr. Khaitan could dream up for his heroine?) Badrinath turns up in Singapore, too, and it¡¯s on this non-Indian ground that the movie hammers home its point: A real man is one who respects women, or in his case, learns to. (And, yes, it¡¯s sad that the movie¡¯s simple moral has currency in present-day America as well as in India.)If ¡°Badrinath¡± ends up being less about female empowerment than about schooling gents on a cardinal rule, its pop comes from Ms. Bhatt.

That¡¯s one of the durable truisms of ¡°Battle of the Sexes,¡± a glib, enjoyable fictionalization of the 1973 exhibition tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. She was 29 and one of the top female tennis players in the world. He was 55 and had been a world champion before she was born. She was a feminist symbol and the first female athlete to win more than $100,000 in a single year; he was a self-avowed male chauvinist pig who liked to gamble big. It was a man vs. woman match made for maximum public-relations gimmickry but also a deadly serious referendum on equality on and off the court.So it was personal and it was political, which ¡°Battle of the Sexes¡± gets. It was also entertainment, which is where the movie really excels. Nice and easy, it sets the players and early 1970s scene, with Billie Jean (Emma Stone) already making history and Bobby (Steve Carell) largely sidelined. She¡¯s making waves as a player and as a champion of women¡¯s rights, including equal pay, and earning plaudits from the likes of President Nixon. Bobby seems to be living off his indulgent wealthy wife (Elisabeth Shue), a frozen smiler right out of Stepford, and spending time on idle in a fancy office. Mostly, Billie Jean is winning while Bobby is keeping boredom at bay. The directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton make these early scenes pop, cramming characters and information into Billie Jean and Bobby¡¯s separate realities. Billie Jean¡¯s is livelier, more engaging, partly because there¡¯s more at stake and because she¡¯s surrounded by chummy, pleasurably prickly women like Rosie Casals (Natalie Morales) and Gladys Heldman (a tangy Sarah Silverman), the founder of Tennis World magazine. Together with seven other top female players, these three form a feminist revolt called the Virginia Slims tour, a women¡¯s pro circuit that sets out to combat the gross inequalities that defined professional (open) tennis since its advent in 1968. As the sunny, sporty feminists stake their rightful claim ¡ª holding press conferences, drumming up support, winning and winning some more ¡ª a rather dark, clubbier male world comes into view. A gambler, Bobby watches Billie Jean on TV but hangs with masters of the universe, male cigar chompers and scotch swirlers who think nothing of betting away a Rolls-Royce. It looks like a lethal bore, as does Bobby¡¯s home, where he plays with his young son under a conspicuously large and looming portrait of his wife. By the time Bobby is challenging Billie Jean to play it almost seems as if he were willing himself into the arms ¡ª or at least company ¡ª of this other woman.It takes a while for them to meet on the court, partly because Billie Jean initially turns Bobby down. So instead, he takes on Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), the Australian champion who becomes the movie¡¯s female heavy. (The real Ms. Court has played that role off screen for her views on same-sex marriage and homosexuality, which she¡¯s branded ¡°a lust for the flesh.¡±) In a well-publicized faceoff soon called the Mother¡¯s Day Massacre, Bobby defeats Margaret, a loss that Billie Jean feels she needs to correct. It¡¯s game on, though with complications, including Billie Jean¡¯s revelatory attraction to another woman, a hairdresser, Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough). Ms. Faris and Mr. Dayton handle the many moving parts in Simon Beaufoy¡¯s busy script smoothly as they toggle between intimate moments and public events, and set Billie Jean¡¯s bedroom sighs off against Bobby¡¯s heat-seeking braggadocio. There¡¯s a lot to follow and a great deal to look at, including an atmospherically embellished past that turns the movie into a veritable wayback machine of amusing and amusingly unfortunate colors and choices. (The director of photography is Linus Sandgren; the production designer is Judy Becker.) There are plaid jackets and flirty minis, sideburns and shags, harvest-gold drapes and rooms perilously fogged in by cigarette smoke.A revolution can be tough to squeeze into two hours, but ¡°Battle of the Sexes¡± manages it mostly by skipping along its handsome surfaces. The film repeatedly announces that there¡¯s a lot at stake here, but without much urgency or sting. Bobby¡¯s sexist pronouncements are outrageous, but his stunts are so absurd and self-serving that they¡¯re hard to take seriously. And while Mr. Carell bounces and sags persuasively, the characterization is finally so soft that Bobby comes off as more needy and pathetic than threatening. The better foil and villain is a tennis promoter, Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman), one of those men who never bothers to hide his contempt for women. Billie Jean faces down Kramer at one point, speaking feminist truth to power: ¡°It¡¯s when we want a little bit of what you¡¯ve got,¡± she says, ¡°that¡¯s what you can¡¯t stand.¡± It¡¯s a solid gotcha moment, but the reason it works as well as it does is its low-key realism, which underscores the absolute ordinariness of the sexism she¡¯s calling out. Ms. Stone handles the scene exactly right, letting you see the tremor of indignation while keeping righteousness in view yet also in check. She¡¯s unsurprisingly good and often moving, although the best thing about the performance is that Ms. Stone hasn¡¯t been asked to play the girl who seduces us with big eyes and a smile. Billie Jean is a woman, and that¡¯s a win.",0.721957296951477,"Biography"

In other news, Paramount has just released a movie called ¡°Baywatch,¡± starring Dwayne Johnson in the role of the beach daddy originated by David Hasselhoff.The film, directed by Seth Gordon (¡°Identity Thief,¡± ¡°Horrible Bosses¡±), can be viewed from several perspectives, most notably the abdominal, the pectoral and the gluteal. If torsos and tails are not your thing, other aspects of human anatomy are also available for study. Arms and legs, for example. But though acres of flesh are exposed to view ¡ª most of it pleasingly sculpted ¡ª there is very little outright nudity and no sex to speak of.You will, however, witness some rude and suggestive sight gags and an extended sequence in a morgue involving the genitals of a dead man. Those bits, and the energetic profanity in the script (written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift), represent cosmetic alterations intended to secure an R rating, at the moment a mark of credibility in the world of big-screen comedy. Make no mistake, though: The project¡¯s essential network prime-time DNA remains intact. Like its source material, ¡°Baywatch¡± is sleazy and wholesome, silly and earnest, dumb as a box of sand and slyly self-aware. It¡¯s soft-serve ice cream. Crinkle-cut fries. A hot car and a skin rash. Tacky and phony and nasty and also kind of fun.Not everything is surf and sand and eye candy, though. A movie requires a plot or five, and ¡°Baywatch¡± barrels through enough action and story to fill a couple of hours. Mitch Buchannon (Mr. Johnson) is the guru and patriarch of a squad of lifeguards ¡ª a ¡°family,¡± as every franchise team in this fast and furious age must be called. The other principal members are C. J. (Kelly Rohrbach) and Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera). They must supervise three trainees: Summer (Alexandra Daddario), Ronnie (Jon Bass) and Matt (Zac Efron, looking uncannily like a young, ripped and shrunken Mr. Hasselhoff). Matt is a gold-medal-winning Olympic swimmer in disgrace, a bad boy in need of reforming. Ronnie is a pudgy nerd, with tech-geek skills and a brain-melting crush on C. J. Summer is there for Matt to ogle and flirt with, and to attest to the screenwriters¡¯ utter inability to make a woman in a bathing suit an interesting character. Mr. Efron and Mr. Johnson are permitted to be funny and look sexy in their swimwear. The women mostly run to the rescue in their zippered one-pieces.A partial exception is Priyanka Chopra, who appears not in a bathing suit but in a succession of slinky dresses that signify ¡ª along with her purring diction, her muscle-headed minions and her collection of champagne flutes and martini glasses ¡ª her character¡¯s supervillain status. That character, Victoria Leeds, is a drug dealer and would-be real estate mogul whose machinations threaten the Bay. And the only people with the integrity, gumption and sleuthing skills to save it are Mitch and his lifeguards. The Bay is their life, after all.For anyone contemplating the purchase of a ticket, the stakes are quite a bit lower. ¡°Baywatch,¡± which, incidentally, features Mr. Johnson¡¯s most credible acting since ¡°The Tooth Fairy,¡± slots neatly into a subgenre that is perhaps too sloppy to have a name. But if you enjoy the ¡°21 Jump Street¡± or ¡°Ride Along¡± franchises, you won¡¯t have too bad a time. The soundtrack hums with well-chosen, not-too-obvious hip-hop, R&B and rock classics; the humor is knowing and naughty without risking serious offense; and an inclusive brand of meta-ness is practiced. You don¡¯t need to be privy to any particular ¡°Baywatch¡± lore to get the jokes, and you¡¯ll see a few nimble comic performers (Hannibal Buress, Yahya Abdul-Matteen II) in too-small roles.You shouldn¡¯t expect much in the way of cinema.

The back-and-forths of the character¡¯s decisions feel real, and Mr. Dickinson¡¯s laconic blankness (you would never guess the actor was British) helps to give Frankie¡¯s existential crisis a charge.

We may be divided by class, race, ideology and any number of other forces, but many of us also cling to the belief ¡ª or the delusion ¡ª that a larger consensus still holds us together. Failing that, we can at least still be nice to one another when the occasion requires. Can¡¯t we?¡°Beatriz at Dinner,¡± a new film directed by Miguel Arteta and written by Mike White, unflinchingly addresses that question, and declines to provide a comforting answer. The setting is a dinner party at a Southern California mansion made awkward by the presence of the title character, a massage therapist played with regal composure and understated mischief by Salma Hayek. The differences of background and economic status between Beatriz and her hosts are obvious enough, and the film hardly ignores them. But this is neither a simple satire of privilege nor a mock-provocative comedy of diversity and its discontents. It¡¯s about a clash of values, about unresolvable contradictions. Or to put it another way, about good and evil.Beatriz, who lives with dogs and goats and who works mainly with cancer patients at an alternative-healing center, is undoubtedly good. But because she is a Mike White heroine, she is also complicated, sometimes abrasive and not always pleasant to be around. She demonstrates obvious kinship with the characters played by Molly Shannon in ¡°Year of the Dog¡± (which Mr. White wrote and directed) and Laura Dern in the HBO series ¡°Enlightened¡± (which he created). Her righteousness doesn¡¯t make her saintly. It makes her interesting. The same word could apply to her nemesis and dinner-party sparring partner, a rich and powerful real estate developer with the slightly too on-the-nose name of Doug Strutt. Played with almost indecent relish by John Lithgow, Strutt has the smile of a cat who swallows a bushel of canaries at every meal. He is a big-game hunter and an all-around winner at the game of life, for whom money and wives (he¡¯s with his third, Jeana, played by Amy Landecker) are signs of achieved destiny. He¡¯s boorish, blustery and also charming in his way. And while he and Beatriz have nothing in common, each can lay claim to a kind of integrity, an honest view of the world and their existence in it. The rest of the company is more ordinary ¡ª nice people, hypocrites, unable to comprehend the moral conflict raging in front of them. The hostess, Kathy (Connie Britton), who sincerely regards Beatriz as a friend, had insisted, over the objections of her husband, Grant (David Warshofsky), on including Beatriz after her car broke down in Kathy and Grant¡¯s driveway. Grant is a business partner of Doug¡¯s, involved in a deal that also includes Alex (Jay Duplass) who arrives with his wife, Shannon (Chlo<U+00EB> Sevigny). Small talk is made and decorum is observed, until Beatriz figures out who Doug is and decides to confront him.Mr. Arteta ¡ª who collaborated with Mr. White on ¡°Chuck and Buck¡± (2000) and ¡°The Good Girl¡± (2002), and whose other films include ¡°Youth in Revolt¡± and ¡°Cedar Rapids¡± ¡ª doesn¡¯t push the evening toward melodrama or farce. He directs with a dry, Bu<U+00F1>uelian touch, savoring small absurdities and letting the larger themes hover in the soft Orange County air. It¡¯s up to Beatriz to bring them up, to spoil the party and bring the movie to life.The seriousness of its themes in no way detracts from the delight in watching Ms. Hayek and Mr. Lithgow perform their eccentric, intricate dance. Their commitment to the idiosyncrasy and unpredictability of their characters creates an unusual kind of suspense, a slightly uncomfortable kind of increased alertness. Where will this argument go next? How will it end?Not well, unfortunately. I don¡¯t mean that something terrible happens, but rather that the filmmakers don¡¯t quite succeed in bringing their story to a credible conclusion. But having said that, I have to admit that I have no idea what such a thing might look like. ¡°Beatriz at Dinner¡± is about unresolvable contradictions, after all, which may mean that its failures are less specific than systemic.

It¡¯s ¡°Beauty and the Beast,¡± for goodness¡¯ sake: a tale as old as time, a song as old as rhyme and all that. And there are inspired flights of nostalgia as well, visual evocations of the predigital glory of Busby Berkeley, Ray Harryhausen and other masters of fantastical craft.But this live-action/digital hybrid, directed by Bill Condon and starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in the title roles, is more than a flesh-and-blood (and prosthetic fur-and-horns) revival of the 26-year-old cartoon, and more than a dutiful trip back to the pop-culture fairy-tale well. Its classicism feels unforced and fresh. Its romance neither winks nor panders. It looks good, moves gracefully and leaves a clean and invigorating aftertaste. I almost didn¡¯t recognize the flavor: I think the name for it is joy.This was by no means a foregone conclusion. The reanimation of beloved properties ¡ª to use the grim business nomenclature of Hollywood ¡ª often leads to hack work and zombie-ism, as old archetypes are shocked to life and arrayed in garish, synthetic modern effects. That might easily have happened here. Look (I mean: don¡¯t look) at the horrors that have been visited, in recent years, on Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz. And even if Disney had done a more convincing upgrade, on the model of last year¡¯s ¡°Jungle Book,¡± a new ¡°Beauty¡± could have offended fans of the 1991 animated feature simply by existing. That movie, a high point of the ¡¯80s and ¡¯90s Disney revival, is close to perfect. What singing teapot would dare to challenge Angela Lansbury? The only possible answer is Emma Thompson, whose Mrs. Potts is joined by other household objects with the voices (and, briefly, the faces) of movie stars. Stanley Tucci and Audra McDonald are the excitable harpsichord and the operatic wardrobe; Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen are the suave candelabra and the anxious clock. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the lissome feather duster. Young Nathan Mack is Chip, Mrs. Potts¡¯s son. Their singing and banter is so vivid and so natural that you almost take for granted that they appear to be mechanical objects clicking and whirling in physical space, sharing the frame with human characters. There are a few moments ¡ª a climactic high-elevation fight scene that looks like every other climactic high-elevation fight scene; a chase through the forest involving wolves ¡ª where the digital seams show, and you¡¯re aware of the cold presence of lines of code behind the images. Most of the time, though, you are happily fooled. More than that: enchanted. The most dazzling visual flights are matched to the best of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken¡¯s songs. ¡°Be Our Guest¡± in particular is a choreographic extravaganza that enfolds decades of Disney history (all the way back to ¡°Snow White¡± and ¡°Fantasia¡±) in contemporary cinematic craft.But the tradition of Disney features, both live action and animated, rigorously places spectacle in the service of plot. The audience needs to be, by turns, reassured and surprised, guided through startling and suspenseful events toward a never-in-doubt conclusion. The new ¡°Beauty and the Beast,¡± written by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos, smoothly modernizes ¡ª and to some degree sanitizes ¡ª a story with a potentially thorny psychosexual subtext, a tale of male animality and female captivity. He¡¯s a beast and a prince. She¡¯s his prisoner and his therapist. It¡¯s a little kinky if you stop to think about it, and also (to use a more responsible word) a little problematic.Variations on the beauty-beast theme are hardly scarce. What else is ¡°Twilight¡± (the last two movie installments were directed by Mr. Condon)? Or ¡°Fifty Shades of Grey¡±? ¡°Beauty and the Beast¡± decisively removes itself from such company by insisting on the heroism and competence of its heroine, Belle, a bookish and ingenious young woman who lives with her father (Kevin Kline) in a picture-book French village.Ms. Watson, already something of a feminist pioneer thanks to her portrayal of Hermione Granger in the ¡°Harry Potter¡± movies, perfectly embodies Belle¡¯s compassion and intelligence. Mr. Stevens, blandly handsome as a human prince, is a splendid monster, especially when the diffidence and charm start to peek through the rage. The awkward business about imprisonment turning into true love is handled smoothly. If you want a hot and haunting ¡°Beauty and the Beast,¡± check out Jean Cocteau¡¯s version, or the fan-fiction-inspiring television show from the 1980s. This one is chaste and charming. It¡¯s Disney! Which means there will also be a villain and a comical sidekick, who steal many scenes on the way to their comeuppance. That would be Gaston (Luke Evans), a narcissistic cabbage-stomping former soldier and his adoring pal LeFou (Josh Gad). Gaston is sweet on Belle, and his excitement at her unambiguous refusals makes him the film¡¯s avatar of nastiness. No redemption here. He goes from annoying to evil when he stirs up the anti-intellectualism and xenophobia of a populist mob to serve his own egomaniacal ends.

The mood of morbid, smiling-through-tears sentimentality recalls ¡°The Fault in Our Stars,¡± ¡°Me and Earl and the Dying Girl¡± and ¡°If I Stay.¡± The filmmakers take the sting out of death in two ways: by dissolving tragedy in a dubious, not-quite-religious metaphysical scheme and by making the principal characters so generic that they barely exist in the first place.

Ms. Russo-Young¡¯s earlier films (including ¡°You Won¡¯t Miss Me¡± and ¡°Nobody Walks,¡± which she wrote with Lena Dunham) can be intriguingly oblique, using the natural diffidence of millennial characters to suggest hidden reservoirs of frustration, hostility, sorrow and desire.

While any explanation of this fraught phenomenon feels like an oversimplification, Mr. Dotan sorts out the forces and personalities that shaped the movement, going back to the 1967 Six-Day War that provided the territorial gains that enabled some Israelis, with a range of ideologies, to stake out newly occupied lands.The film takes viewers into the living rooms (and, in one case, the yurt) of Jews who have moved onto Palestinian land.

Some of today¡¯s settlements of spacious homes with swimming pools have tunnels that allow residents to zip to Israel proper. Keeping settlers safe, the film notes, is costly.

A meet-cute with an intellectual schoolteacher named Andi (Max Riemelt) leads to flirtation, an intense sexual assignation and an unsettling discovery the morning after.

It soon becomes horrifically apparent that the not-leaving component is part of a larger scheme that Andi has enacted before.I can¡¯t speak from personal experience, but it seems the stages of captivity aren¡¯t too different from the stages of grief. Once disbelief subsides, Clare starts to rage, but Andi¡¯s living quarters are diabolically designed to contain her and her anger.The movie is based on a 2011 novel of the same name by Melanie Joosten, but viewers of a certain age will detect an affinity with ¡°The Collector,¡± the 1965 picture by William Wyler, based on a John Fowles novel. The director, Cate Shortland, making her third feature, depicts both the degradations endured by Clare and the peculiar psychological ins and outs of the captor-captive dynamic in explicit, sometimes excruciating detail. Her insistent imagery and sometimes oblique narrative approach don¡¯t always deliver the dividends sought. But the movie identifies Ms. Shortland as a talent to watch.

Early on in  ¡°Bill Frisell: A Portrait,¡± Mr. Frisell, a quiet, diffident man, tells an off-camera interviewer that when he gets up in the morning, he picks up a guitar, starts playing ¡°and then ¡­¡± he drifts off. The suggestion is that he never stops.Directed by Emma Franz, this project has clearly been in the works for a long time. Three of its interviewees, all music greats, have died in recent years: the jazz guitarist Jim Hall, also a teacher of Mr. Frisell¡¯s; the remarkable drummer Paul Motian, with whom Mr. Frisell played in a groundbreaking jazz trio with Joe Lovano; and the wonderful, albeit widely misunderstood, guitarist John Abercrombie, who provides an interesting technical analysis of Mr. Frisell¡¯s style and tone, among the most distinctive and recognizable in contemporary music.I am a fervent fan of Mr. Frisell¡¯s. I¡¯ve been following his work since the mid-1980s; I¡¯ve seen him perform live twice this year, and might try to catch one of his shows this weekend at Jazz Standard.Nevertheless, there are several points in this movie ¡ª which I¡¯m still recommending ¡ª that I found, if not boring, a little dry. In a sense, Mr. Frisell, 66, is an entirely atypical contemporary musician. As the impresario and record producer Hal Willner notes early in the documentary, despite Mr. Frisell¡¯s having performed or recorded with literally hundreds of other top-flight players and troubadours, ¡°there¡¯s no one who has a bad word to say about him.¡± Being a ¡°no drama¡± person is lovely, and it¡¯s particularly salutary that Mr. Frisell upends the myth that the great artist needs to be full of anger, or to behave badly, to be inspired. These qualities, however, don¡¯t always make entirely compelling cinema. A cab ride through London with Mr. Frisell¡¯s former teacher, the composer and conductor Michael Gibbs, is frankly a little drowsy. Once the duo, who are working on a collaborative concert, reach their destination, a radio station, they are directed to a studio called ¡°the Barbarella Room.¡±On the way there, Mr. Frisell recalls what he remembers as ¡°the only illegal thing¡± he has ever done: as a 15-year-old, gaining entry to a theatrical screening of ¡°Barbarella,¡± the very tame, sex-in-outer-space ¡¯60s film starring Jane Fonda, when the movie was restricted to viewers over 16.

Its enchantments are dark, its ideas somber and brutal. Adapted by Pedro Rivero and Alberto V¨¢zquez from Mr. V¨¢zquez¡¯s graphic novel, the film, originally called ¡°Psiconautas¡± (¡°Psychonauts¡±), conjures a bleak vision of a post- or perhaps mid-apocalyptic landscape of predation, addiction and demonic possession.

This documentary, directed by Civia Tamarkin and written by Ms. Tamarkin and Luchina Fisher, argues that new laws have stripped away health services unrelated to abortion and have deprived women, particularly those with lower incomes, of routine care. While women¡¯s clinics and providers were attacked by violent extremists and closed as funding dried up, more insidious, less publicized changes, including the legislation and the mergers and acquisitions that brought hospitals under the control of religious groups, were having far-reaching effects.The case histories are stacked to support the film¡¯s point of view, but that doesn¡¯t make them less painful. Worst are the new mothers jailed on child-abuse charges because of drug tests administered without their knowledge. The victims are the babies, left motherless. One woman had to wait out a nonviable pregnancy because the law forbade inducing labor after 20 weeks.

(As it happens, Manji can be rubbed out, just exceedingly slowly ¡ª like, over years.) Based on the eponymous long-running manga series by Hiroaki Samura, the story opens on a stunning black-and-white battle that leaves Manji mortally wounded and his little sister slain.Out of nowhere, an ancient crone appears and stuffs sacred worms into his wounds. Like slimy paramedics, the creatures rejoin his gashes and gloppily reattach his severed hand, but Manji feels more cursed than blessed.

But Rin looks exactly like his sister, and a ¡°True Grit¡± connection develops that will send them on one of the bloodiest quests in samurai history.It¡¯s also one of the most bonkers.

Dick, accomplished something more unusual. It sent tendrils of influence ¡ª pictorial, conceptual and spiritual ¡ª into every corner of the culture and inspired a mystery cult.Like other sacred texts, the film invites doctrinal arguments and esoteric inquiries. One of my fondest memories as a father and a film critic is of an impromptu post-screening seminar with two 11-year-olds about occult meanings and hidden clues in the director¡¯s cut. How do we know (if indeed we do know) that Harrison Ford is a replicant? What is the significance of the origami unicorn? Are Sean Young¡¯s shoulder pads for real?[Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling Discuss ¡°Blade Runner 2049¡±]Alongside these basic interpretive questions, an academic subfield has blossomed, isolating ¡°Blade Runner¡± as one of the original symptoms of postmodernism, a terminal and interminable disease of the mind. The film¡¯s blend of curatorial nostalgia and dystopian prophecy captured a mood of self-conscious melancholy in its moment and set a tone of melancholy self-consciousness that has endured ever since. Maybe the real world never quite achieved the smoky neon-noir glow of Mr. Scott¡¯s Los Angeles, but the map of our collective dream world was permanently redrawn. The precise future ¡°Blade Runner¡± projected is now less than two years away, and the next chapter, once something to be dreaded, seems, if anything, overdue. ¡°Blade Runner 2049,¡± directed by Denis Villeneuve from a script by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, tries both to honor the original and to slip free of its considerable shadow. That¡¯s no easy feat, and it¡¯s worth noting right away that, in narrow movie terms, Mr. Villeneuve, who also directed ¡°Arrival,¡± mostly succeeds. From the opening aerial shots of a thoroughly denatured agricultural landscape and the lethal confrontation that follows, we know we are in the presence of a masterly visual tactician and a shrewd storyteller. [The ¡°Blade Runner 2049¡± Look]We are also in territory that is both familiar and disorienting. A brief note explains what has and hasn¡¯t changed in the 30 years since the events in the first ¡°Blade Runner.¡± Three-wheeled spinners still zoom through the California skies, and the building-size video advertisements have evolved into seductive, R-rated holograms. The titular profession ¡ª hunting down and ¡°retiring¡± renegade members of the almost-human, genetically engineered android species known as replicants ¡ª is practiced with the same brutal doggedness as in the old days.A new, more obedient type of replicant has been developed by a corporation led by a tech visionary played by Jared Leto. (His lieutenant Luv is played by Sylvia Hoeks, a far more vivid and persuasively terrifying presence than the mannered Mr. Leto.) One of these models is our hero, an L.A.P.D. employee known as K. (It¡¯s an abbreviation of his serial number and also, maybe, an allusion to Franz Kafka¡¯s avatar of modern alienation. That poor fellow¡¯s full name was Josef K; when this K acquires a human pseudonym, it¡¯s Joe.) Speaking of avatars of alienation, K moves through his days with the unhurried shuffle and downcast baby blues of Ryan Gosling. This is impeccable casting. Mr. Gosling¡¯s ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it ¡ª his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa ¡ª makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time. He is also, in 2017, something close to what Harrison Ford was 35 years ago: the contemporary embodiment of Hollywood¡¯s venerable ideal of masculine cool, a guy whose toughness will turn out to be the protective shell encasing a tender soul. At first, of course, we must take that sensitivity on faith. K does his grim job thoroughly and without complaint, showing the weary, cynical patience of an old-time shamus. His commander (Robin Wright) is a human who believes that everything depends on policing the border between her kind and K¡¯s. The whole point of ¡°Blade Runner,¡± though, is that such boundaries are always blurred and porous. K comes home each night from work to the company of Joi (Ana de Armas), his devoted girlfriend, who happens to be a commercially produced artificial intelligence application.We are prepared to acknowledge the pathos and the paradox of her condition, which is a version of K¡¯s own. The idea that synthetic humans harbor feelings, desires and dreams ¡ª that they are mirrors of us, that we are replicas of them ¡ª has long been a staple of speculative cinema. ¡°Blade Runner 2049¡± does not wander as deep into this ontological thicket as, say, Steven Spielberg¡¯s ¡°A.I.¡± or Spike Jonze¡¯s ¡°Her,¡± but like those movies it uses the conceit of the suffering cyborg as ethical and emotional ballast, a spur to the audience¡¯s curiosity as well as our compassion. A political theme also asserts itself: These replicants are an enslaved labor force; their exploitation is the fuel on which this civilization runs.There is a something to think about here, a fair amount to feel and even more to see. Mr. Villeneuve has conspired with the cinematographer, Roger A. Deakins; the production designer, Dennis Gassner; and the special effects team to create zones of strangeness that occasionally rise to the level of sublimity. The movies Mr. Villeneuve has directed ¡ª his recent English-language features include ¡°Sicario,¡± ¡°Prisoners¡± and ¡°Arrival¡± ¡ª are full of violence and psychological intensity, but what distinguishes them from other high-end genre spectacles is an unnerving calm, as if he were exploring and trying to synthesize the human and mechanical sides of his own sensibility. Movies are by their nature hybrids of technology and sentiment, machines for the delivery of human emotion. The first ¡°Blade Runner¡± approached this as a philosophical problem and an artistic challenge. Mr. Scott used imagery borrowed from old Hollywood, German Expressionism and the nascent art of music video to create a dazzlingly artificial environment where authenticity was out of the question. Except, of course, that it was the question: How do we know what is real, ourselves included?¡°I know what¡¯s real,¡± says the hero of that movie when ¡ª at long last! ¡ª he shows up in this one. K finds Deckard, the original Blade Runner (Mr. Ford, as if I needed to tell you), in an abandoned Las Vegas casino, surrounded by shimmering bottles of whiskey and primitive 3-D projections of Elvis and Frank Sinatra. Mr. Gosling, suddenly overmatched in the masculine cool department, acquits himself well enough, and Mr. Ford does exactly what you expect him to do. Which is not something I¡¯m going to explain, at least as far as it relates to the story. The studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics not to reveal plot points. That¡¯s fair enough, but it¡¯s also evidence of how imaginatively impoverished big-budget movies have become. Like any great movie, Mr. Scott¡¯s ¡°Blade Runner¡± cannot be spoiled. It repays repeated viewing because its mysteries are too deep to be solved and don¡¯t depend on the sequence of events. Mr. Villeneuve¡¯s film, by contrast, is a carefully engineered narrative puzzle, and its power dissipates as the pieces snap into place. As sumptuous and surprising as it is from one scene to the next, it lacks the creative excess, the intriguing opacity and the haunting residue of its predecessor.As such, ¡°Blade Runner 2049¡± stands in relation to ¡°Blade Runner¡± almost exactly as K stands in relation to Deckard before the two meet: as a more docile, less rebellious ¡°improvement,¡± tweaked and retrofitted to meet consumer demand. And the customers are likely to be satisfied. But now and then ¡ª when K and Deckard are knocking around the old gambling palace; when K visits an enigmatic mind-technician played by Carla Juri ¡ª you get an inkling that something else might have been possible. Something freer, more romantic, more heroic, less determined by the corporate program.Then again: Who knows at this point if that sense of loss, of lost possibility, is even real? It might be nothing more than an artificially implanted memory.",0.997234935906684,"Sci-Fi"

It¡¯s a fair enough question, not least because Brad is played by Ben Stiller, a frighteningly high-strung performer even at his mellowest. Mr. Stiller, lean as a greyhound and gray around the temples, occupies the volatile middle ground between decent fellow and abrasive jerk, between adequacy and failure. He¡¯s a regular guy perpetually threatening to turn into that guy, embarrassing the rest of us by association.In ¡°Brad¡¯s Status,¡± Mike White¡¯s astute, cringy and ultimately kindhearted new film, Mr. Stiller undergoes a midlife crisis that has less to do with restlessness or lust than with a dreadful loss of perspective. Brad, who runs a small nonprofit, lives in a handsome Craftsman-style house on a leafy Sacramento block. His wife, Melanie (Jenna Fischer), who works in state government, is patient and devoted. Troy (Austin Abrams), a rising high school senior, is an excellent student, a gifted musician and an all-around good kid. Brad lives in a soft pocket of the American dream. He should be counting his blessings, or at least checking his privilege.Instead, he dreams of the greener grass where his old college pals frolic, consumed with envy for their gilded, fast-track lives. As he and Troy prepare to head east for a tour of potential colleges ¡ª Brad, who went to Tufts, is amazed to learn that his son is Harvard material ¡ª he is seized by anxieties that quickly migrate from the practical to the existential. The question of whether he and Melanie will have enough money for Troy¡¯s tuition gives way to a resentful reckoning with his peers. How come he doesn¡¯t have as much as they do?These four men occupy a prime parcel of professional, personal and actual real estate. Nick (Mr. White), is a Hollywood director whose house has recently been featured on the cover of a glossy shelter rag. Jason (Luke Wilson) is a hedge-fund mogul with a bevy of blond kids and a private jet. Billy (Jemaine Clement), having made a fortune in tech, now lives in polyamorous retirement on a beach in Maui. Craig (Michael Sheen) has parlayed a political career into best-selling authorship and television celebrity. What do they have that Brad lacks? Where did he go wrong? Why does he only rate a worthless silver airline rewards card, instead of gold or platinum? He ruminates on these and related matters in long passages of voice-over narration, brought back to reality by the ringing of his cellphone or the needs of his son.Brad also reconnects with his old friends ¡ª three of the four, at least ¡ª who drop hints that they may have problems of their own. Everybody does. And Mr. White is committed to giving everyone a fair hearing. He specializes in exquisitely awkward scenes made more so by his evenhanded sympathy. In one especially acute moment, Brad unburdens himself to a Harvard undergraduate named Ananya (Shazi Raja) who is a friend of Troy¡¯s from back home. Rather than singing harmony with Brad¡¯s white man¡¯s blues, she rebukes him for his unthinking white male entitlement. ¡°You¡¯re 50 years old and you still think the world was made for you,¡± she marvels.She has a point. So does he. His angst is real, as are the gradations of social hierarchy that cause it. But in the bigger picture, his misery is trivial. Mr. White could easily have loaded the satiric dice, emphasizing Brad¡¯s Gen-X self-absorption or Ananya¡¯s millennial self-righteousness, but he suspends judgment, leaving the viewer hanging in an exquisitely uncomfortable limbo. What are we supposed to think? We¡¯re supposed to think for ourselves.And ¡°Brad¡¯s Status¡± at its best is genuinely thought-provoking. As a writer, television creator and director ¡ª his r¨¦sum¨¦ includes ¡°Beatriz at Dinner,¡± ¡°Year of the Dog¡± and the HBO series ¡°Enlightened¡± ¡ª Mr. White has honed a comic sensibility that avoids cruelty and minimizes exaggeration. He is attuned to the political implications of individual behavior and also to those aspects of experience that can¡¯t be politicized. His characters are bundles of contradictory impulses and qualities. They are admirable and awful, full of idealism and full of themselves, weird and entirely familiar.Sometimes you might wish he pushed them harder. ¡°Brad¡¯s Status,¡± a worthy addition to the burgeoning genre of empty-nest movies, smooths more feathers than it ruffles. In spite of Mr. Stiller¡¯s displays of doubt and discomfort, the movie protects him from humiliation and finds a safe space for Brad¡¯s bruised ego. There is something a little disappointing about this, but also something honest, since the movie¡¯s message is that what looks like disappointment should be embraced as the only real happiness there is.",0.626090476493338,"Comedy"

For one thing, the buildup is so grippingly patient that we¡¯re more than halfway through before the titular battleground is reached. And for another, this painstakingly paced thriller displays an intensity of purpose that makes it impossible to dismiss as well-executed trash.Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, the movie stars a revelatory Vince Vaughn as Bradley Thomas, a recovering alcoholic, laid-off mechanic and newly expectant father. A charismatic bruiser with a baby-soft face and piledriver body, Bradley favors a dry turn of phrase ¡ª when asked how he¡¯s doing, he responds ¡°South of OK, north of cancer¡± ¡ª and a placid demeanor. This last is blown when, early on, we watch him rip apart his wife¡¯s car with his bare hands.He has good reason. But the implacability of the act, and the meticulous deconstruction of the vehicle, reveals not only Bradley¡¯s brute strength and boiling point, but also his director¡¯s death grip on style and tempo. And when Bradley¡¯s temporary drug-running job with an old associate (Marc Blucas) goes south and he¡¯s forced to navigate a series of increasingly atrocious confinements, Mr. Zahler and his cinematographer, Benji Bakshi, never lose focus. Rejecting the jittery shooting style and sped-up splatter that distinguishes so many modern action movies ¡ª where mayhem flashes past too swiftly to register as a valid plot point or viable moral outcome ¡ª they plant their camera with such eerie stillness that every punch has traction.There are a lot of punches. Like Mr. Zahler¡¯s 2015 debut, the clever horror-western ¡°Bone Tomahawk,¡± ¡°Brawl¡± features violence that¡¯s lurid and often ludicrous. (At some point, I lost count of the heads being mashed, bashed and ground into the dirt.) Yet Bradley, stripped to a single, galvanizing intention ¡ª to save his kidnapped wife (Jennifer Carpenter) and unborn daughter by killing a high-value inmate ¡ª never loses our sympathy. His fundamental decency has been so carefully established (even the detective questioning him knows this is no ordinary lug) that the medieval damage he inflicts with fists and feet seems, if not always justifiable, at least understandable. The role must have been punishing, but, perhaps for the first time, Mr. Vaughn seems comfortable in his towering body. Bradley isn¡¯t flyweight-nimble, he¡¯s a battering ram, and the director wisely surrounds him with wickedly agile supporting players. Both Don Johnson and the great Udo Kier are memorably repulsive as a sadistic warden and a slimy go-between, and Fred Melamed is chillingly hilarious as a persnickety prison intake officer.But it¡¯s Mr. Vaughn, with his loose-hipped gait and simmering menace, who brings the movie home. Wrapped in a swaggering soundtrack of ¡¯70s-style soul (composed by Mr. Zahler and Jeff Herriott, and performed by the likes of Butch Tavares and the O¡¯Jays), he gives Bradley a forlorn determination. There is something so poignant in the performance that it lifts this uncompromisingly savage picture above and beyond its vicious beat-downs.

He was also instrumental in helping other severely disabled patients regain theirs, collaborating with his friend Teddy (Hugh Bonneville), an amateur inventor, to design a wheelchair with a built-in ventilator and traveling to Europe to promote its use.This exceptional life, however, is smothered by a cloying fairy tale romance that turns every challenge the couple faces into a lark.

Ms. Okpokwasili¡¯s fearless writing and intense, virtuosic performance style make the story, of two black girls discovering their sexuality while growing up in the Bronx, seem torn from her own life.

The narrative unfolds via a series of letters Ms. Okpokwasili reads from, but her words are punctuated by movements that are at times balletic, at other times pure James Brown meets punk rock.

His best-known titles, ¡°I Am Love¡± and ¡°A Bigger Splash,¡± feature beautiful people with impeccable taste experiencing haute-bourgeois life intensely. Passion and drama upend those lives, but what¡¯s most striking about these movies is their extraordinary palpable quality. In Mr. Guadagnino¡¯s work, passion and drama are expressed in words, deeds and surging music but also in the vibrant, visceral textures that envelop his characters ¡ª the cool marble, succulent fruit, shadow and light, sheens of sweat. These are movies that turn your gaze into near-touch, inviting you to see and almost caress their sun-warmed bodies.Mr. Guadagnino¡¯s latest, ¡°Call Me by Your Name,¡± is another ravishment of the senses, though this time there¡¯s a strong narrative tethering all the churning feelings and sensuous surfaces. Like the 2007 novel by Andr¨¦ Aciman on which it¡¯s based, the story turns on an affair between Elio Perlman (Timoth¨¦e Chalamet), a coltish 17-year-old American-Italian, and Oliver (Armie Hammer), an American in his 20s. Elio lives with his father (a tremendous Michael Stuhlbarg) and mother (Amira Casar) in a villa in northern Italy. Each summer the father, a professor of Greco-Roman culture, invites a student to work with him and stay with his family; this year it¡¯s Oliver who moves in. Elio and Oliver¡¯s affair begins slowly with each circling the other at a distance, conveying the kind of nonchalance that¡¯s a shield for interest. Oliver proves far better at this part of the game; he knows more than to look too long and too hard. Elio¡¯s furtive, ducking glances, by contrast, tend to linger, hovering in the air like questions. He¡¯s increasingly curious about this new guest, but soon inexplicably (to Elio, at least) irked by him as well, leading Elio to complain to his parents about Oliver¡¯s standard signoff (¡°later¡±). But when Elio scribbles a private rebuke in a notebook, chastising himself for responding harshly toward Oliver, it¡¯s as if he were writing an apologetic love letter. Mr. Guadagnino is very good at catching the indolent drift of long summer days, with their sleepiness and bared limbs. Everyone seems to move in slow motion at the villa, except perhaps the family¡¯s hard-working maid. This languor fits the tempo of Elio and Oliver¡¯s relationship, which evolves over meals, drowsy idylls, a little work and a spontaneous piano recital that becomes an overture to seduction. A gifted musician, Elio easily moves from piano to guitar (much as his family shifts from speaking Italian to French to English), talent that makes him seem at one with the villa¡¯s miles of bookshelves, its velvet sofas, scattered Oriental rugs and tastefully arranged antiques. It¡¯s an alluring milieu ¡ª charming, civilized and perfectly, if a shade too flawlessly, arranged. Here, even a busy breakfast table and the fruit on a tree can seem art directed. Mr. Guadagnino almost can¡¯t help making everything look intoxicating, yet he also makes you believe in this family¡¯s reality. The grand piano isn¡¯t for show and neither are the books or the open affection and respect with which Elio and his parents treat one another. (The movie reminds you how rarely characters read for pleasure, much less listen to classical music.) ¡°Call Me by Your Name¡± is set in 1983, so no one is staring into a smartphone. And the time frame means that AIDS doesn¡¯t figure in the story, though there¡¯s a suggestion that the closet does.The story primarily unfolds through Elio¡¯s point of view. The restless camera tags alongside him, showing you what he sees, his erotic reveries and yearning. And it¡¯s Elio who initiates the affair, at least overtly, though Oliver later admits to playing his part in what the story frames as a mutual seduction. Mr. Guadagnino avoids directly engaging the difference in Elio and Oliver¡¯s ages, which might have forced him to explore the underside of his sumptuous surfaces to greater, messier effect. Instead, Mr. Guadagnino leans on beauty, as when Elio¡¯s father poetically speaks to an increasingly agitated Oliver about the ¡°ageless ambiguity¡± of some male statues (¡°as if they¡¯re daring you to desire them¡±). Written by James Ivory (the director of films like ¡°Maurice¡±), ¡°Call Me by Your Name¡± progresses through evasions and encounters, with Elio advancing, Oliver receding and their circling narrowing. The two don¡¯t (can¡¯t, won¡¯t) always say what they mean. So Mr. Guadagnino speaks for them by eroticizing their world, making desire visible in the luxuriousness of the setting, in the green enveloping the villa, the gushing waters of a pool and the graceful lines of male statues. When Oliver hungrily eats a soft-boiled egg, cracking the shell and causing the yolk to messily spurt, Mr. Guadagnino¡¯s lyricism slides into comedy; it¡¯s hard to know just how self-mocking the moment is meant to be. Even so, the lyricism seduces as does fragile, ecstatic Elio. ¡°Call Me by Your Name¡± is less a coming-of-age story, a tale of innocence and loss, than one about coming into sensibility. In that way, it is about the creation of a new man who, the story suggests, is liberated by pleasure that doesn¡¯t necessarily establish sexual identity. It¡¯s important that Elio and Oliver have relationships with women, though for seemingly different reasons: the overheated Elio sleeps with a girlfriend (Esther Garrel), while Oliver carries on a more performative affair with a local (Victoire Du Bois). The women are not treated with much kindness, but these affairs further complicate the movie¡¯s vision of pleasure¡¯s fluidity.There are moments when Mr. Guadagnino¡¯s visual choices seem unintentionally in competition with the quieter, intricate emotions that his actors put across so movingly. He can be discreet to the point of coyness (bodies sweat but don¡¯t necessarily grunt), but it is finally the insistent delicacy and depth of emotion that makes these characters so heart-skippingly tender. The charismatic Mr. Chalamet, Mr. Hammer and Mr. Stuhlbarg ¡ª whose brilliant delivery of a tricky speech pierces the heart and, crucially, the movie¡¯s lustrous patina ¡ª transform beauty into feeling. In one alive, vulnerable and life-altering summer, Elio¡¯s desire finds its purpose. He loves, and in loving, he becomes.",0.994995072153455,"Drama"

Though his new feature, ¡°Canners,¡± takes place in the present, a relatively safer and more prosperous era, it demonstrates that New York remains, in several senses, a tough place.The film consists of interviews with about a dozen people who scavenge bottles and cans from garbage bins and recycling piles, collecting a nickel for each one at supermarkets and redemption centers. There are easier ways to make money. A shopping cart loaded with overstuffed bags represents a full day¡¯s work and a payout of $30 or $40. And the stories Mr. Kirchheimer¡¯s subjects tell about themselves are full of hardship and heartbreak.

But if you can roll with it, the movie is both breezy fun and a pain-free life lesson delivery vehicle.It begins predictably, with the cheerful, cherry red Lightning McQueen (voiced with the usual winning pep by Owen Wilson) about to zip across another finish line in first place.

Hooking up with a new corporate sponsor, he starts his off-season training at a top-tier site where, apparently, newbies such as Jackson Storm tone up. There, he¡¯s introduced to a plucky performance coach, a yellow car named Cruz Ramirez (voiced by Cristela Alonzo). She responds to Lightning¡¯s frequent angry, pessimistic outbursts with an instruction to ¡°Use that!¡± For a while, the movie is content to poke mild fun at America¡¯s enthusiasm for trendy self-help bromides and computer-age enhancement technology. There¡¯s a mild paradox that this entirely digital movie waxes so nostalgic for analog-age stuff: Art Deco diners, big-knob radios, funky garages. Lightning frequently flashes back to the advice and companionship of his old mentor, Doc Hudson (voiced by the great Paul Newman in the first ¡°Cars¡± movie in 2006, two years before his death, and who is again heard here). Acting on those memories, Lightning eventually persuades Cruz to get out and train with him, old-school style, at a nearby beach.It¡¯s here that the movie¡¯s pedagogic mode starts, gently, to kick in. Lightning begins to realize that maybe he really is too old to be a champion on the track anymore ¡ª so what¡¯s next? And Cruz reveals her thwarted ambition to be a racer, a dream she abandoned out of fear the first time she was told to take her shot. In a quiet but ultimately forceful way, ¡°Cars 3¡± makes a case against sexism and for the joys of mentorship. Because the ¡°Cars¡± franchise has been Lightning¡¯s story, the male lead is, by that logic, the initial force moving the female-empowerment theme. That may strike some as a little patronizing.

Several dozen professional and nonprofessional actors audition onscreen for roles in the movie you¡¯re watching, which is pegged to the 1996 murder of JonBenet Ramsey, the 6-year-old beauty-pageant contestant from Boulder, Colo., who became a post-mortem media sensation. Her murder remains unsolved, which hasn¡¯t stopped its exploitation. The director Kitty Green¡¯s big idea here is to explore the tragedy and its aftershocks through the reactions of actors playing those involved in the case, including JonBenet¡¯s parents. Some girls ¡ª smiling, dressed and made up as little beauty contestants ¡ª play JonBenet.Ms. Green doesn¡¯t bother with the usual nonfiction signposts; there is no accompanying text or voice-over to serve as a guide. Instead, she records one performer after another on various soundstage sets who usually sit or occasional stand facing the camera, reciting (or reading) dialogue or holding forth on the real case. When speaking freely, some offer theories, a few darkly sensationalistic and sinister; a few theorists seem reasonable, but others come across as preposterous. Some seem to sympathize with the Ramseys, while others voice biases against the family. Some participants appear detached; still others register as deeply engaged, speaking about the case with an air of authority. Ms. Green moves from actor to actor, moment to moment smoothly, sometimes with vaguely sinister lighting, camerawork and music. The vibe is vaguely Errol Morris lite, though several setups suggest she also admires the fine-art photographer Gregory Crewdson, known for his moody, staged tableaus of suburban and small-town surrealism. It¡¯s a handsome package that never transcends the banality of its ideas, most of which involve how different people, including from Boulder, were affected by the case. This is somewhat interesting for 30 or so minutes but grows grindingly obvious as we¡¯re reminded again and again that people have feelings and opinions, some dubious. For the most part, Ms. Green does not obviously engage with her participants, but instead lets them talk into the camera. Every so often, a performer drifts or rushes into an apparent digression, as when one, who self-identifies as a ¡°sex educator,¡± pulls out a few of his flogging whips and begins twirling them. It¡¯s the kind of moment that another director might have cut. Ms. Green, by contrast, seems to believe that this moment adds something (outr¨¦ humor, perhaps), but she doesn¡¯t indicate what it might have to do with the rest of her movie or with the Ramsey case. This forces viewers to fill in the uninteresting blanks using her earlier cues and their own imaginations.That kind of filmmaking reserve or perhaps simply coyness is a stale tactic, one that too often gestures at nonexistent complexity. It¡¯s a familiar game ¡ª call it theorizing by proxy for meaning by proxy ¡ª in which a filmmaker waves toward an idea, say, Brecht¡¯s concept of the alienation or estrangement effect, without doing any actual hard, intellectual work. ¡°Casting JonBenet¡± is filled with such ritualistic gestures that signal the movie has things of merit to say about assorted well-trod themes: identity as performance; performance as identity; the reproduction of gossip; the impact of media sensationalism; the sexualization of young girls; and that biggie, the United States. The only substantive conclusion, though, is that murder can be endlessly exploited. The question of whether the movie exploits JonBenet¡¯s death is obvious; of course it does. The better question is whether it¡¯s meaningful exploitation. To that end, consider the scene in which a few boys performing as JonBenet¡¯s 9-year-old brother try to smash a melon with a flashlight while wearing goggles and rain gear. A couple succeed, and one boy eats a bit of melon. The idea, presumably, is to see whether one child could smash another child¡¯s head in. The ridiculousness of the scene ¡ª and the melon ¡ª suggests that Ms. Green believes there¡¯s something absurd about all of this, including the desire to know what happened. It also suggests that she lacks compassion. Vulgar in the extreme, the scene invites us to laugh, which is probably easier to do if you ignore the child who died.",0.0444515587501632,"Documentary"

Instead it focuses on the insecurity, competitiveness and complicated love lives of these two ambitious men of opposite temperament. Anyone who has spent much time in artistic and literary circles will recognize that this is how it is even today.¡°C¨¦zanne et Moi¡± begins in 1888 in M¨¦dan, northwest of Paris, when Zola, then in his late 30s, was a world-famous author and the reputation of the late-blooming C¨¦zanne was gathering steam. It then immediately flashes back to 1852, when they were rambunctious schoolboys, with C¨¦zanne the daredevil who took Zola the follower under his wing. The movie restlessly jumps around in time, cramming almost more information than you can take in. And it is so eager not to come off as a lecture in art history the film presumes a high level of knowledge of French culture and history ¡ª more than most American viewers might possess.Mr. Gallienne, who dominates the film, gives an electrifying portrait of C¨¦zanne as a scruffy, driven wild man who even as his career seems stalled, declares, ¡°I¡¯ll never stop painting; I¡¯ll die painting.¡± Charismatic but scary, flashing a furious, wide-eyed glare that could turn people to stone, C¨¦zanne is a foul-mouthed misogynistic boor and selfish voluptuary who shocked polite society with his profanity and who in his later years was obsessed with his declining virility. Although C¨¦zanne played to the hilt the role of contemptuous bohemian rebel, he came from a wealthy family from which he was largely estranged. Zola, who was born in poverty, assiduously worked his way up the social ladder. Paradoxically, his raw realistic novels shocked the very bourgeoisie he professed to loathe but whose approval he eagerly courted.¡°C¨¦zanne et Moi¡± offers a pungent, demystifying portrait of the rowdy late-19th-century Parisian art world where famous painters and poets mingled and jostled for position at dinner parties and art openings filled with shoptalk, backbiting and intrigue.It also makes a point of showing the profound self-doubt that led C¨¦zanne to attack his canvases in fits of rage and Zola to consider destroying his manuscripts. Creativity for both men, who were acutely aware of their diminishing powers as they aged, is more agonizing than ecstatic.There is an abundance of gorgeous outdoor scenes, many set in Aix-en-Provence, where C¨¦zanne is shown at work amid the fullness of nature. And famous paintings of the period are alluded to both in the dialogue and in shots that evoke the imagery of Manet¡¯s masterpiece, ¡°Le D¨¦jeuner sur l¡¯Herbe.¡±Mr. Canet¡¯s Zola, who resembles William Hurt in one of his more prim, buttoned-up roles, seems miscast as the author who maintains an unswerving loyalty to C¨¦zanne in his life if not in his writing. The friendship is all but shattered with the publication of Zola¡¯s novel ¡°L¡¯Oeuvre,¡± whose barely disguised portrait of C¨¦zanne as a ¡°castrated, defeated, pathetic loser,¡± in the painter¡¯s words, hurts him to the quick.

Using his 2012 documentary, ¡°Chasing Ice,¡± in which time-lapse technology showed the melting of glaciers, as his guide, Mr. Orlowski frames ¡°Chasing Coral¡± with a similar structure. But setting up time-lapse camera rigs deep underwater off the coasts of Caribbean islands, Hawaii and Australia proved problematic. At one point, the assembled team of researchers has to document the deadly transformation of the Great Barrier Reef manually: diving with special cameras to meticulously record the day-to-day changes on the ocean floor. Once-thriving marine metropolises, teeming with sting rays, turtles, little yellow fish and big-eyed predators, gradually wither away into a wasteland of muck.The film gives a scientific breakdown of the biology of coral (these complex organisms play a vital role in the marine ecosystem) and the cause of the bleaching events leading to its demise: Trapped greenhouse gases have been warming oceans more rapidly since the 1980s, and a two-degree increase is fatal. But the film is particularly compelling when following Zack Rago, a self-proclaimed coral nerd whose love is palpable and infectious. The work takes a toll on his spirits, never more so than when after weeks of dives, he encounters what has essentially become a grave site, barely resembling what was once a fertile haven. Perhaps the most striking moment is when the divers must cross the deck of a party boat to gain access to a section of the Great Barrier Reef.

There, Harun ¡ª the inspiration for a caliph in ¡°One Thousand and One Nights¡± ¡ª is said to have played polo and perfumed the air with garments worn by female slaves. Raqqa¡¯s later history largely registers as more mundane, a tale of declines and revivals that turned catastrophic when the Islamic State, or ISIS, seized it in 2014, making the city its effective capital. American-backed forces are currently battling ISIS for control of a city in ruins.¡°City of Ghosts,¡± a blunt instrument of a documentary, is an urgent and heart-heavy account of Syrian resistance from the ground up. Specifically, it recounts the story and activism of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, or R.B.S.S., a citizen-journalist initiative that emerged in April 2014 to secretly record the atrocities committed by ISIS in Raqqa. (R.B.S.S.¡¯s website states that the group is nonpartisan and explains that it is ¡°a campaign launched by a group of nonviolent activists in Raqqa to expose the atrocities committed by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and terrorist extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria¡± toward civilians in that city.)Directed by Matthew Heineman, ¡°City of Ghosts¡± primarily focuses on three R.B.S.S. activists identified by their first names ¡ª Aziz, Hamoud and Mohamad ¡ª who, even after being forced to flee Raqqa, intently work to get images and information about the city out into the world. Mr. Heineman, who is also the movie¡¯s cinematographer, more or less opens and closes the documentary in 2015 with some of the activists in New York, where R.B.S.S. received an award from the nonprofit group the Committee to Protect Journalists. It¡¯s a distracting framing device that suggests Mr. Heineman believed that he first needed to give his audience reassuringly recognizable faces. Cut to David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, at the podium.¡°City of Ghosts¡± is best when it lets the activists tell their own stories, which they do in smoothly edited tag-team voice-over, in on-camera scenes from their life abroad and in ghastly underground images recorded in Raqqa. It¡¯s an account of heroic resistance that essentially begins in 2011 when the Arab Spring reached Syria (¡°we started to scream for freedom¡±), and peaceful demonstrations against President Assad were met with state violence followed by power grabs. Along the way, Mr. Heineman furnishes a sketchy look at the various players and geopolitical stakes, glossing over Syria¡¯s historical complexities and the role that the United States has played in the rise of ISIS. The activists come across as ordinary men made extraordinary by circumstance; some seem almost surprised at where life and war have taken them. Aziz was a student who became a spokesman, and Mohamad was a teacher turned reporter, but not much else about the group¡¯s origins comes through. Mr. Heineman glides over the nuts and bolts of its operational beginning. He may not have thought it germane, or maybe thought covering it might have endangered lives. Or perhaps Mr. Heineman, an excitingly visceral director ¡ª his last documentary was ¡°Cartel Land¡± ¡ª thought it might slow this fast-paced feature down. Like the Arab Spring represented in the movie, R.B.S.S. almost seems to have spontaneously erupted.That¡¯s unfortunate because more information and in-depth analysis, as well as greater restraint in the use of atrocity images, might have deepened a movie that leans on shortcuts and visual shocks. In ¡°City of Ghosts,¡± Mr. Heineman marshals some incredible material ¡ª including on-the-run undercover cellphone imagery ¡ª into a moving record of extraordinary individual and collective heroism, one that eventually emphasizes the personal over the political.

Repeatedly, she returns to the dark, ominous forest where he apparently disappeared like some fairy-tale casualty; at times, she dreams of him and his caresses. She holds it together remarkably well, shedding few tears, which suggests promising complications.An elliptical, deliberate slow boil, ¡°Claire in Motion¡± is thicker with atmosphere than plot. It was written and directed by Lisa Robinson and Annie J. Howell (they also wrote and directed ¡°Small, Beautifully Moving Parts¡±), who have a nice way of unsettling a mood, destabilizing a scene and creating a sense of vague threat. When the movie opens, everything seems ordinary, banal: There¡¯s a woman in bed and a man fussing elsewhere in the room. Yet while she lies there, he remains obscured enough that you can¡¯t make out his face when he kisses her goodbye. He¡¯s already a mystery, at least to the viewer. The filmmakers do get around to the standard introductions: Claire Hunger (Betsy Brandt) teaches math at the same Ohio college where her husband, Paul (Chris Beetem), is a professor of ornithology. Together with their son, Connor (Zev Haworth), they live in a nice house in the town of Athens, which appears almost as depopulated as a nuclear test site. The pervasive quiet reinforces Claire¡¯s isolation (her next-door neighbors seem to be her only friends), which seems a bit odd, especially after Paul goes missing. Where are the concerned friends, the worried relatives? (The absence of people here, like some of the rough technical edges, has an unfortunate way of taking you out of the movie.) A few weeks after Claire reports Paul¡¯s absence, the search is dropped. It makes sense (small police department, limited resources, no clues), but leaves Claire without answers. It also ends up stranding the filmmakers, who cook up a narrative diversion in the figure of an arty grad student, Allison (Anna Margaret Hollyman). Paul liked to go off for some kind of extreme solo outdoors adventuring, heading into the deep forest, for instance, with little more than a backpack. As Allison explains to Claire over a succession of dead-end encounters, Paul was also cultivating an entirely separate life from his wife, one involving dubious art, confessional hugs and ukuleles.Allison turns out to be a drag, including on the movie. Unconvincing in the extreme, she adds nothing of interest and succeeds only in drawing attention away from Claire, an already frustratingly diffuse character. Ms. Robinson and Ms. Howell have kitted out their movie handsomely, but there¡¯s not enough story here or enough anything else, namely a persuasive psychological portrait of Claire, to make up for that lack. The filmmakers make good use of their locations and the creeping camera movements and, on occasion, they brighten the gloom with daubs of color ¡ª with Connor¡¯s knitting, a gaudily painted car, the forest green ¡ª that add vibrancy to a tale that¡¯s mutely, almost reluctantly told.",0.742159950703177,"Drama"

The grain of leather and the rusted folds of corrugated metal have a rough, almost tactile quality. Human bones, hairless dogs and orange flower petals look uncannily (but not too uncannily) real. There are moments of cinematic rigor ¡ª when the animators mimic the movements and focal effects of an old-fashioned camera in actual physical space ¡ª that will warm any film-geek¡¯s heart. Not to mention the Frida Kahlo-inspired musical number with dancing papaya seeds.¡°Coco¡± is also one of those Pixar movies that attempt a conceptual breakthrough, an application of the bright colors and open emotionalism of modern, mainstream animation to an unlikely zone of experience. From the very start, the studio has explored the inner lives of inanimate objects like lamps and toys with a tenderness we now take for granted. It has also summoned the post-human future (¡°Wall-E¡±) and the human unconscious (¡°Inside/Out¡±) with breathtaking ingenuity. And now it has set out to make a family-friendly cartoon about death. Don¡¯t let that scare you or your children away. There is a murder (revealed in the third act) and a fatal church-bell-related accident (witnessed in the first), but the afterlife in ¡°Coco¡± is a warm and hectic place, more comical than creepy. The story takes place during the Day of the Dead, when according to Mexican tradition (at least as interpreted by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina, who directed the screenplay written by Mr. Molina and Matthew Aldrich), the border controls between life and death relax and the departed are allowed temporary passage to the land of the living. A young boy named Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) makes the trip in reverse, which is not to say that he dies, but rather that his living self, through one of several metaphysical loopholes that the movie explains as it goes along, is transported into a fantastical world of specters and skeletons, who hold fabulous parties and raucous outdoor concerts. Nearly as enchanting as that magical realm is the Mexican village of Santa Cecilia, Miguel¡¯s hometown, where he is part of a prosperous clan of shoemakers. The cultural vibe of ¡°Coco¡± is inclusive rather than exoticizing, pre-empting inevitable concerns about authenticity and appropriation with the mixture of charm and sensitivity that has become something of a 21st-century Disney hallmark. Here, the importance of family ¡ª the multigenerational household that sustains and constrains the hero ¡ª is both specific and universal. It¡¯s what explains the particular beats of Miguel¡¯s story and what connects him to viewers regardless of background.He shows a certain kinship with other well-known recent cartoon characters. A gifted musician in a family that forbids music, he is a bit like Remy, the ¡°Ratatouille¡± rat whose kin were hostile to his artistic ambition, and like Mumble, the misfit penguin in ¡°Happy Feet.¡± Miguel¡¯s genealogical quest ¡ª a search for roots, lost ancestors and information that might explain who he is ¡ª resembles Dory¡¯s journey in ¡°Finding Dory.¡± The sidekicks who accompany him, animal and (formerly) human, are drawn from a familiar well of archetypes, and the final round of lesson-learning and reconciliation hits notes we have heard many times before. But if ¡°Coco¡± doesn¡¯t quite reach the highest level of Pixar masterpieces, it plays a time-tested tune with captivating originality and flair, and with roving, playful pop-culture erudition. Miguel¡¯s musical role model ¡ª and the source of the family embargo on musical expression ¡ª is a long-dead crooner and movie star named Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). In life and in death, he incarnates venerable ideals of romance and wounded machismo, or at least their show-business incarnations. (His greatest hits and movie clips form part of the texture of ¡°Coco,¡± the way the old ¡°Woody¡¯s Roundup¡± show did in the ¡°Toy Story¡± movies.)The purer embodiment of that tradition is H¨¦ctor (Gael Garc¨ªa Bernal), a ragged, forgotten ghost who befriends Miguel. What links H¨¦ctor with de la Cruz is a lurid story of passion, betrayal and longing. Their lives and deaths are a ballad whose meaning and melody Miguel must learn. In doing so, he will understand the thread that links him to both of them, and also the sources of the anti-musical animus that runs so strongly in his maternal line. Coco is the name of Miguel¡¯s great-grandmother, who turns out to be the heart of the story. Her mother, Imelda (Alanna No<U+00EB>l Ubach), is a furious matriarch on the other side of the grave, while Coco¡¯s daughter, Miguel¡¯s Abuelita (Ren¨¦e Victor), is a no-nonsense flesh-and-blood autocrat. Their determination to silence Miguel¡¯s guitar arises from heartbreak, and from the instrument¡¯s association with the waywardness of men.¡°Coco¡± avoids the darker tones associated with this theme, in the way that old murder ballads are sometimes reconceived as children¡¯s songs.

A jury convicted two young men of the murder, one of whom, Colin Warner, had nothing to do with it. Nonetheless, Mr. Warner spent more than 20 years in prison until, thanks in large part to the tireless efforts of his friend Carl King (known as CK), his conviction was overturned and he was released.This story inspired a gripping, enraging episode of ¡°This American Life,¡± and ¡°Crown Heights,¡± written and directed by Matt Ruskin, tries to adhere both to the factual record and a careful, detail-focused documentary ethos. Like its protagonist, sensitively and shrewdly played by Lakeith Stanfield, the film is soft-spoken and thoughtful, with sweet, lyrical touches that alleviate some of the grimness without blunting the cruelty and injustice of what happened.On the day of the murder, as Colin and CK (Nnamdi Asomugha) go about their routines, ¡°Crown Heights¡± quietly registers the texture of New York life in 1980. The crime and violence that were much more prevalent then than now, but also the daily rituals of love, family and work that never really change. Colin steals a car (for the chop shop where he works), flirts with a neighbor, Antoinette (Natalie Paul), and runs an errand for his grandmother. Then all of a sudden he¡¯s in custody, and ensnared in a bureaucratic and penal nightmare. Months stretch into years, and while CK raises money, hires lawyers and pursues appeals, Colin, incarcerated at the New York state penitentiary in Dannemora, fights to stay sane, safe and hopeful. Our attention shifts back and forth between the two men, which provides narrative momentum at the cost of dramatic and psychological depth. CK¡¯s devotion to the cause of his friend¡¯s exoneration strains his marriage, and the long sequence of stalls and setbacks in court and in parole hearings erodes Colin¡¯s morale. These developments are conveyed in scenes that feel a bit too pointed and familiar ¡ª effective in the moment but not quite as powerful as they might have been. But ¡°Crown Heights¡± nonetheless makes a powerful argument that Colin¡¯s imprisonment was hardly an anomaly. Mr. Ruskin cuts in news clips of several generations of politicians from both parties ¡ª including Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and former New York Gov. George E. Pataki ¡ª making tough-on-crime speeches promising longer sentences, more executions and less parole. In the meantime, the kinds of policies they promote take their toll on Colin.Like countless other black men, he is ensnared in a system that seems rigged against him in every way. The police, the prosecutors, the prison guards and some of his own lawyers cut corners, rush to judgment and ignore the clear evidence of his innocence. You get the sense that they are part of a vast, shadowy, brutal machine, the illumination of which feels urgently necessary even as it lies outside the film¡¯s scope.But the choice to focus on Colin rather than on his persecutors is an honorable and ethical one, and ¡°Crown Heights¡± is a moving tribute to his resilience and the steadfastness of the people who love him.",0.952822130647388,"Drama"

Havana has seen a lot of change, but in some ways it still earns its reputation for being frozen in time.Mr. Alpert¡¯s movie is a personal examination of the ways Cuba changed and did not change over the course of the 45 years he has been visiting and filming there, shooting over 1,000 hours of footage in the country and even accompanying Castro on one memorable trip to the United States.The director¡¯s story begins with cofounding the Downtown Community Television Center, where he used scrappy video equipment to expose sweatshops and chronicle labor struggles in New York. His interest in Cuba grew out of his activism: ¡°We heard that Fidel Castro was implementing the social programs that we were fighting for here in New York,¡± Mr. Alpert states plainly.

Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister best known (then and still) for his policy of appeasing Hitler, was replaced by Winston Churchill, whose first weeks as head of the government ¡ª culminating in the Dunkirk evacuation ¡ª are the subject of ¡°Darkest Hour,¡± Joe Wright¡¯s new film. (The evacuation itself was reconstructed in Christopher Nolan¡¯s ¡°Dunkirk,¡± released in July.)Considered as history, ¡°Darkest Hour,¡± written by Anthony McCarten (¡°The Theory of Everything¡±), offers the public a few new insights and details about the practice of statecraft in a time of crisis. Churchill is disliked by many of his colleagues in the Conservative Party (notably Chamberlain and his vulpine sidekick, Viscount Halifax) and distrusted by King George VI. The political situation is shaky, the military reports dire. The new prime minister, a man of large emotions and larger appetites, who drinks whiskey with breakfast and is rarely without a cigar, is plagued by frustration and doubt as he tries to navigate between two bad options. Will Britain enter into a ruinous war or submit to humiliating and most likely temporary peace on terms dictated by Hitler? The contours of this story are reasonably familiar. The outcome even more so. (Just in case, a helpful text before the final credits reminds us that Germany eventually lost the war.) Churchill himself is among the most revered and studied figures of 20th-century history: a synonym for leadership; a great man in an age of monsters; a source of pithy quotations, some of which he actually said; an example to be cited by political mediocrities in need of an ego boost. And, of course, an irresistible role for actors of every shape and size. (His American counterpart in this regard is not Franklin D. Roosevelt, Churchill¡¯s partner and peer, but Lyndon B. Johnson, who also possessed impressive jowls and a colorful way with words.) Gary Oldman, aided by diligent makeup artists and propelled by his own unmatched craft and discipline, embraces the task with almost palpable delight. The challenges facing Churchill are of lethal seriousness, but the key to his effectiveness is his capacity for pleasure. He enjoys the push and pull of politics, the intellectual labor of problem-solving and the daily adventure of being himself. In grasping that joy, Mr. Oldman partakes of it and passes it along to the audience. He is having fun, playing the part in every sense. And his blustery, blubbery charm, backed as it is by a sly and acute intelligence, is hard to resist.Apart from Halifax and Chamberlain, desiccated aristo puddings played by Stephen Dillane and Ronald Pickup, nobody makes much of an effort. Churchill is regarded with frank adoration by the camera and by the people, the women in particular, charged with the tasks of attending and indulging him. Kristin Scott Thomas is his wife, Clementine Churchill, a woman of brisk confidence and ironic disposition who long ago made peace with her secondary place in his public life. Lily James is his secretary, Elizabeth Layton, a clever and wide-eyed English rose who types Churchill¡¯s correspondence and chastely buoys his morale at difficult moments. King George is played by Ben Mendelsohn as a weary and aloof sovereign ¡ª a chillier, sadder fellow than the version incarnated by Colin Firth in ¡°The King¡¯s Speech.¡± ¡°Darkest Hour,¡± a companion to ¡°Dunkirk,¡± is also in several senses a sequel to ¡°The King¡¯s Speech,¡± a mildly enjoyed best picture winner. It is similarly a movie about the production of an important piece of rhetoric, a ¡°mobilization of the English language¡± in the service of a vital and righteous cause.And like ¡°The King¡¯s Speech,¡± Mr. Wright¡¯s film is a serviceable enough historical drama. But like ¡°Dunkirk,¡± it falls back on an idealized notion of the English character that feels, in present circumstances, less nostalgic than downright reactionary, and as empty as those ubiquitous ¡°Keep Calm and Carry On¡± internet memes. Rather than invite the audience to think about the difficulties of democratic governance at a time of peril, the filmmakers promote passivity and hero-worship, offering not so much a Great Man Theory as a great man fetish. Their sham populism is most evident in a ridiculous scene in which Churchill rides the London Underground and meets The People, a motley mass of stiff upper lips and brimming eyes. Churchill¡¯s resolve, like the bravery of the soldiers, airmen and ordinary Britons in ¡°Dunkirk,¡± is offered not as a rebuke to the current generation, but rather as a sop, an easy and complacent fantasy of Imperial gumption and national unity. Standing up to the Nazis, an undeniably brave and good thing to have done, is treated like a moral check that can be cashed in perpetuity. ¡°Darkest Hour¡± is proud of its hero, proud of itself and proud to have come down on the right side of history nearly 80 years after the fact.

So tackling ¡°Death Note,¡± the sprawling, gobsmackingly detailed Japanese manga series by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, is a ballsy move ¡ª even if you¡¯re backed by Netflix. And for the director Adam Wingard, who needs a win after last year¡¯s disappointing ¡°Blair Witch¡± sequel, the prospect of riling those fans must have been especially daunting.Devotees of Mr. Wingard, on the other hand, will immediately recognize a sensibility ¡ª rare among horror-movie directors ¡ª that prioritizes mood over mayhem. From the dreamy opening to the flashback-heavy finale, the movie has a tone and temperament that are consistently his own. The sharply executed violence, jabs of humor and, in particular, a fascination with the seductiveness of evil (most pronounced in his 2014 feature, ¡°The Guest¡±) are all here, albeit in a compressed package.Set in Seattle (played by Vancouver, British Columbia), the story centers on Light (Nat Wolff), a smart, isolated high schooler whose world is upended when an ancient, leather-bound notebook drops from the heavens. Inside are instructions: Picture the face and write the name of whomever you would like to kill, and that soul¡¯s expiration is assured. A test run to eliminate a troublesome bully is spectacularly successful, and soon Light and his girlfriend, Mia (an underserved Margaret Qualley), are wiping out evildoers worldwide.Lurking in Light¡¯s bedroom, however, is the actual killer: A mischievous Japanese death spirit named Ryuk (voiced with cackling relish by Willem Dafoe), who resembles a rotting tree trunk and behaves like an annoying goad. Yet this malevolent house pest is far less worrisome than L, a ninja-styled ¨¹ber-detective who is obsessively investigating the murders. As played by a mesmerizing Lakeith Stanfield, L is a twitchy oddity with an attentive handler (Paul Nakauchi) and a back story that deserves its own spinoff. Face half hidden beneath a black turtleneck, L crouches on chairs like an anime arachnid, sucking up candies and sniffing out clues. By far the more entertaining of the two mythically entwined antagonists, L zeros in on Light with eccentric speed. And that¡¯s the problem: Perhaps stifled by the cultural and commercial clout of its source material (a multimedia juggernaut of books, movies, television shows and a stage musical), ¡°Death Note¡± feels rushed and constricted. As a result, what should have been Light¡¯s incremental surrender to godlike power becomes an instantaneous embrace, and what ought to have played out as an extended manhunt is resolved with embarrassing ease.Cramming several tons of plot into a one-pound screenplay, the three writers (one of whom, Jeremy Slater, created Fox television¡¯s thoughtful adaptation of ¡°The Exorcist¡±) have little option but to condense. That said, Mr. Wingard¡¯s eye for a stylish image hasn¡¯t dimmed. Working with the cinematographer David Tattersall, he concocts sequences that tilt and drift, awash in neon and a soundtrack that evokes a woozy, winking romanticism.

(Nearly every white character with a speaking role wears a uniform of some kind.) Occasionally things go in the other direction, with ¡°they¡± referring to the white authorities, but the reversal doesn¡¯t indicate any kind of symmetry.The movie, which paints a sometimes muddled picture of a chaotic and contested moment in history, is admirably clear in this regard. It understands and strives to dramatize racism not as a matter of bad personal attitudes or equal and opposite prejudices, but rather as a structuring fact of American life, an apparatus of power, exclusion and control wielded against ¡°them.¡± Ms. Bigelow and Mark Boal, the screenwriter (who collaborated with her on ¡°The Hurt Locker¡± and ¡°Zero Dark Thirty¡±), train their focus on two aspects of the Detroit story: the day-to-day texture of working-class black life and the operations of white supremacy in conditions of emergency. Balancing those concerns is no easy task, and the filmmakers don¡¯t take an easy route through their material. ¡°Detroit,¡± like its namesake city, is populous and contradictory, with dozens of significant characters competing for attention as richly detailed scenes swell in crescendos of desperate suspense and sickening brutality. At moments (the quietest as well as some of the most intense), you feel in tune with both the fine grain of experience and the larger sweep of history. The specific, close-up acts of cruelty you witness are comprehensible as manifestations of a systemic, continuing and frequently invisible pattern of injustice. The film¡¯s struggle against simplification ¡ª against the sentimentality, wishful thinking and outright denial that defines most Hollywood considerations of America¡¯s racial past ¡ª is palpable, almost heroic, even if it is not always successful.Early scenes ¡ª following a gorgeous animated prologue that uses Jacob Lawrence paintings to evoke the decades of job discrimination, residential segregation and heavy-handed law enforcement that preceded the 1967 riots in Detroit and other Northern cities ¡ª zero in on the rebellion¡¯s immediate cause: a late-night police raid on an unlicensed saloon.The opening 20 minutes register Ms. Bigelow¡¯s virtuosity as a choreographer of chaos. She illuminates volatile and unpredictable circumstances with amazing poise and precision, producing an intuitive understanding of events that quickly spiral beyond the control or comprehension of their participants. Her combination of efficiency and expressiveness is matched by the actors ¡ª a formidable, mostly youthful ensemble including John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith and Jason Mitchell ¡ª even though the script at times inhibits their range, locking them into simple stances of aggression and fear.Amid the fire and looting and the audio and video clips of the Michigan governor George W. Romney and President Lyndon B. Johnson, a narrower plot takes shape, a real-life horror movie folded into a baggier film that feels, by turns, like a combat picture, a cavalry western, a police procedural and a courtroom drama. The fates of a collection of black and white Detroiters (as well as two unlucky visitors from Ohio) converge at a motel on the west side of the city. Two friends, Fred (Jacob Latimore) and Larry (Mr. Smith), are looking for a little fun after a disappointing evening at the Fox Theater downtown. They flirt with Karen (Kaitlyn Dever) and Julie (Hannah Murray), two white women, and join a makeshift party in a room belonging to Carl Cooper (Mr. Mitchell).Down the hall is Greene (Anthony Mackie), a soldier just back from Vietnam. A few blocks away, Melvin Dismukes (Mr. Boyega), a black security guard protecting a grocery store, brings coffee to a group of National Guardsmen, a gesture of diplomacy as well as self-protection. ¡°I don¡¯t want those boys shooting at us,¡± he tells his co-worker. Meanwhile, three patrolmen cruise the city. One of them, Krauss (Mr. Poulter), is still on the job after fatally shooting an unarmed looting suspect in the back.The nightmare that brought them all together is remembered as the Algiers Motel incident. It¡¯s a notably ugly chapter in the annals of late-60s urban violence, and one that has an especially grim resonance in our own time. Three black men were shot to death ¡ª nine other people were terrorized and beaten ¡ª after the police and guardsmen arrived at the motel, responding to reports of sniper fire.Real events depicted in movies can¡¯t exactly be given away, and this episode, while not as notorious as some other race-related murders of its era, isn¡¯t all that obscure. (It is the subject of a book by John Hersey, a writer for The New Yorker, published a year after the riots and reissued in 1997 with an informative introduction by the historian Thomas J. Sugrue.) The basic arc of the story ¡ª the killing of unarmed black men, the spasm of outrage, the impunity ultimately bestowed on the perpetrators ¡ª is always shocking and rarely surprising. I¡¯m sorry if that¡¯s a spoiler. What matters more to Ms. Bigelow and Mr. Boal than plot twists or surprises ¡ª and to an audience torn between the urge to lean in and the desire to look away ¡ª is the minute-by-minute unspooling of accident, error and intentional evil that produced a tragic result. The important thing is not the literal accuracy of the overall account (though Mr. Boal, a former journalist, has been diligent in his research) but its plausibility. Is this what could have happened? Does it feel true?The answers, of course, can hardly be objective. The language of cinematic action ¡ª which Ms. Bigelow speaks as fluently and inventively as any living American director ¡ª is an idiom of feeling and visceral response. There are parts of ¡°Detroit¡± that have a raw, unsettled authenticity, and others that sink in a welter of screaming and cursing.The Algiers becomes a trap, not only for the characters, who are stuck inside at the mercy of a maniac, but for the film itself, which loses its political and psychological coherence as the night drags on. Krauss, with his disconcertingly boyish looks and his sophomoric attempts to seem thoughtful, is a callow sociopath. His fellow officers Flynn (Ben O¡¯Toole) and Demens (Jack Reynor) contribute sexual hysteria (when they see white women in the company of black men) and sheer idiocy. They are terrifying and contemptible ¡ª dismayingly believable figures from the prehistory of what is now called the alt-right.But as their villainy comes into relief, the humanity of their hostages begins to blur. In a horror movie, the monster is inevitably the center of interest, and once the first body in the motel falls, ¡°Detroit¡± begins to trade its vivid sense of nuance ¡ª especially present in its delicate observation of Fred and Larry¡¯s friendship ¡ª for bluntness and sensationalism. A complex, dreadful piece of history becomes an undialectical ordeal of viciousness and victimhood.The film opens with the assertion that in Detroit and elsewhere in the mid-1960s, ¡°change had to come¡± and ¡°the question was when and how.¡± But the promise implied in that ¡°how¡± is one that ¡°Detroit,¡± for all its impressive craft and unimpeachable intention, proves unable to fulfill. It is curious that a movie set against a backdrop of black resistance and rebellion ¡ª however inchoate and self-destructive its expression may have been ¡ª should become a tale of black helplessness and passivity. The white men, the decent ones as much as the brutes, have the answers, the power, the agency.The filmmakers seem aware of this problem. They try toward the end to give the movie back, in effect, to its African-American characters, to refuse to let racism have the final word and to free themselves of storytelling conventions that insist on comfort and consensus. It doesn¡¯t quite work. American movies have a hard time with division and with real-world problems that have yet to be solved. American politics does, too. The great virtue of ¡°Detroit¡± is that it recognizes this difficulty. The failure to overcome it is hardly the film¡¯s alone.",0.879812452327947,"Crime"

A radically dystopian future seems like the best we deserve these days, and it was impressive to see a summer blockbuster offer such harsh medicine.Alexander Payne¡¯s new movie, ¡°Downsizing,¡± doesn¡¯t go nearly as far. Surveying a landscape of impending ecological catastrophe, it proposes a future that is only mildly dystopian and prescribes laughter rather than apocalyptic despair as, if not exactly a remedy, then at least an acceptable palliative. We don¡¯t need to disappear altogether, but it might be better all around if we weren¡¯t so darn big.Mr. Payne¡¯s title refers not to corporate cost-saving strategies but to a technological procedure invented by scientists in Norway and adapted for universal, commercial use. People are efficiently and almost painlessly shrunk to around four or five inches. This is sold as an environmental panacea: Our tiny selves will take less of a toll on the earth¡¯s resources and produce less waste. The burden we impose on our hot, crowded planet is expected to decrease proportionally. But Mr. Payne is a canny student of modern American culture and in particular of the ways his fellow citizens conflate selfishness and virtue. The real attraction in becoming small isn¡¯t that you consume less; it¡¯s that you can have a whole lot more. That¡¯s what Paul and Audrey Safranek, an Omaha couple played by Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig, discover. Compared with their regular-size lives of compromised dreams and diminished expectations, downsizing promises luxury and abundance. Once they liquidate their modest assets, they can move into a mansion in a planned community called Leisureland and pursue a guilt-free vision of material happiness. The hard sell is provided, at a surreal seminar, by Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern. What could go wrong? Mr. Payne, who wrote ¡°Downsizing¡± with his frequent collaborator Jim Taylor, zooms in on the fine print in the contract ¡ª in other words, on the ways our ingrained fallibility upends our utopian projects. Paul, having undergone the irreversible (and hilariously detailed) reduction, finds himself unexpectedly alone in Leisureland. The world of ¡°the small¡± ¡ª who are somehow both an oppressed minority and a privileged elite ¡ª is afflicted by the usual problems. Selfishness and deceit haven¡¯t disappeared, and bigger injustices still exist. Paul sees a news report about a political dissident involuntarily made tiny by an oppressive government and later discovers festering inequality around Leisureland itself. Some of the familiar contradictions of 21st-century capitalism are magnified as Paul, a Gulliver gone native in Lilliput, eventually discovers.Mr. Damon¡¯s regular-guy affability carries the movie through its expository phase, which is a lot of fun. Mr. Payne has an admirably concrete logistical sense and an eye for amusing incongruities. The transition from big to small is full of clever touches, like the spatulas that lift the newly shrunken out of their suddenly oversize beds, as if they were freshly baked one-bite cookies.Paul, big and small, is just interesting enough to be good company. He is friendly, but with that hint of heartland hostility that is layered into every Alexander Payne hero¡¯s temperament like a smear of hot mustard in a bologna-and-cheese sandwich. Paul¡¯s passivity gives the movie a leisurely rhythm unusual in both science fiction and satire, the two genres that ¡°Downsizing¡± nods toward without fully embracing.Instead, the movie resembles an episode of ¡°The Twilight Zone¡± directed by Preston Sturges. An outlandish, pointedly allegorical conceit is inhabited not by symbolic figures but by terrestrial oddballs. You don¡¯t see this at first, because Mr. Payne is so charmed by the conceit itself. Like a video gamer uninterested in winning and in no hurry to advance to higher levels, he knocks around the corners and side streets of his invented reality, treating it the way he treated Hawaii in ¡°The Descendants,¡± wine country in ¡°Sideways¡± and his beloved Nebraska in most of his other movies ¡ª as a picturesque, lived-in backdrop for the spectacle of human ridiculousness. About an hour in, ¡°Downsizing¡± amps up that ridiculousness in risky and wonderful fashion. Just when we (along with Paul) assume we¡¯ve figured out the rules and boundaries of this place, Christoph Waltz shows up as Paul¡¯s upstairs neighbor, an international man of mystery named Dusan. Shortly thereafter, Paul meets Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident who becomes the agent of his ethical and romantic reawakening. For a delirious while, fueled by Mr. Waltz and Ms. Chau¡¯s zigzagging comic energies, we are transported to a land beyond genre, a zone of pure comic sublimity.And then, with a bit of a thud, this kinetic and good-natured movie discovers its limitations and shrinks before our eyes. Mr. Payne and Mr. Taylor, roaming freely in their conjoined imaginations, wander off into the bushes and then stumble into the middle of the road. Paul¡¯s journey loses direction and momentum, and sour, nagging questions begin to intrude. Haven¡¯t we seen this story before, in which a white man¡¯s anomie is cured by the love of an exotic woman? Did we come all this way to rediscover the ouroboros of guilty liberal self-consciousness?Well, yes, as it turns out. But then again the whole point of the movie is the scaling down of expectations to arrive at something like an accurate sense of scale, and disappointment may be a perverse sign of success. ¡°Downsizing¡± is an ambitious movie about the value of modesty, and its faults are proportionate to its insights. I sort of wish it felt like a bigger deal, but maybe that¡¯s my problem.",0.874170316301833,"Comedy"

The movie recounts an early, harrowing campaign in World War II that took place months after Germany invaded Poland and weeks after Hitler¡¯s forces started rolling into the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. The plane, having glided to a stop, has been defiantly set ablaze by the pilot to avoid its being captured. It¡¯s an image of unambiguous defeat but also an emblem of resistance and a portent of the ghastly conflagrations still to come.It¡¯s a characteristically complex and condensed vision of war in a movie that is insistently humanizing despite its monumentality, a balance that is as much a political choice as an aesthetic one. And ¡°Dunkirk¡± is big ¡ª in subject, reach, emotion and image. Mr. Nolan shot and mostly finished it on large-format film (unusual in our digital era), which allows details to emerge in great scale. Overhead shots of soldiers scattered across a beach convey an unnerving isolation ¡ª as if these were the last souls on earth, terminally alone, deserted. (Seen on a television, they would look like ants.) Film also enriches the texture of the image; it draws you to it, which is crucial given the minimalist dialogue. The movie is based on a campaign that began in late May 1940 in the French port city of Dunkirk, where some 400,000 Allied soldiers ¡ª including more than 200,000 members of the British Expeditionary Force, the British army in Western Europe ¡ª were penned in by the Germans. The British, faced with the capture or possible annihilation of their troops, initiated a seemingly impossible rescue. Named Operation Dynamo, this mission has assumed near-mythic status in British history and been revisited in books and onscreen; it shows up in ¡°Mrs. Miniver,¡± a 1942 Hollywood weepie about British pain and perseverance in the war meant to encourage American support for the Allies. War movies tend to play out along familiar lines, including lump-in-the throat home-front tales like ¡°Mrs. Miniver.¡± ¡°Dunkirk¡± takes place in battle, but it, too, is a story of suffering and survival. Mr. Nolan largely avoids the bigger historical picture (among other things, the reason these men are fighting is a given) as well as the strategizing on the front and in London, where the new prime minister, Winston Churchill, was facing the horrifying possibility of diminished military muscle. Churchill is heard from, in a fashion, but never seen. Mr. Nolan instead narrows in on a handful of men who are scrambling and white-knuckling their way into history on the sea, in the air and on the ground. By turns intimate and sweeping, the film opens with six soldiers walking away from the camera down a spookily deserted street. Their bodies are shown in full, head to toe, and they are flanked by low buildings, the sort that now look so charming in touristic photographs. Slips of paper swirl around the men like autumn leaves. A few grab at the papers. One tries slurping water from a nearby garden hose; another pokes a hand through an open window, searching for a smoke. Still another reads one of the papers, which shows a map of the surrounding area encircled by arrows and ominous words of warning in English. He then crumples it, unbuckles his belt and begins to squat.It¡¯s a somewhat perplexing, awkwardly funny moment ¡ª this is a manifestly serious situation, and you¡¯re about to watch a man defecate. You don¡¯t know whether to laugh, but before you decide, shots ring out and the soldiers start running, the camera quickly following. The haunted emptiness is suddenly filled with the sounds of frantic escape and whizzing bullets. And then the men begin falling, one, two, three, until just the unbuckling one remains, scrambling first over a gate and soon onto a beach where thousands of other soldiers are massed and waiting. He silently takes in the extraordinary scene and then hustles over to a dune to begin undoing his belt again. Scarcely a word has been uttered up to this point, yet much has been expressed: isolation; danger; desperation; fear; relief; and sheer, extreme bodily need and effort. Throughout this de facto prologue, Mr. Nolan emphasizes the concrete details, making you acutely aware of the fine-grained textures ¡ª the sores and embedded dirt on a man¡¯s hands ¡ª and every resonant sound: the dribbling of water, the fluttering of paper, and the sharp crack and mechanical buzzing of rifle fire that turns into muffled thuds when bullets enter bodies. By the time the surviving soldier reaches the beach, you are already closely acquainted with his heavy breathing, wild fumbling and clumsy, chaotic running. Soon, the scene switches to another port, where a British teenager, George (Barry Keoghan), is helping a father and son (Mark Rylance and Tom Glynn-Carney) unload a small yacht that¡¯s been requisitioned for the Dunkirk mission. The three men instead set sail on their own, joining a civilian fleet ¡ª a rousing, motley armada of tugs, steamers, ferries and so on ¡ª that¡¯s racing across the Channel. A third, astounding narrative section soon opens in the air, where three British Spitfire planes are quickly engaged in battle against German planes headed for Dunkirk, racing through the vast canopy and bobbing under clouds as the sun flashes, temporarily blinding them. Mr. Nolan¡¯s elastic approach to narrative works beautifully in ¡°Dunkirk,¡± which oscillates among its three sections, each largely taking place in distinct locations in different time frames. The events on the beach ¡ª called the Mole for the breakwater that¡¯s used as a dock ¡ª unfold during one week. The events on the sea occur in one day, while the air scenes transpire in an hour. The locations and the time periods are announced onscreen. At first the dividing lines aren¡¯t always obvious as Mr. Nolan cuts from daytime scenes on the ground to those in the sea and in the air, a slight merging of space and especially of time that underlines the enormity of a fight seemingly without end.Once Mr. Nolan begins switching between day and night, the lines dividing the three narrative segments mostly sharpen. Even as each section ¡ª with its individual dramas and perils ¡ª comes closer into view, Mr. Nolan keeps them all in dynamic play with one another. Some of this he achieves with stark visual echoes, as when water rushing into a downed Spitfire engulfs the pilot and elsewhere a soldier nearly drowns. (Tom Hardy plays the most critically important pilot, while a sympathetic Jack Lowden takes on a critical support role.) At one point, Mr. Nolan pulls the three narrative strands tightly together, creating a tremendous, enveloping sense of bone-deep dread.¡°Dunkirk¡± is a World War II movie, one told through soldiers, their lived and near-death experiences and their bodies under siege. Names are generally irrelevant here; on the beach ¡ª and in the sea and air ¡ª what counts are rank, unit, skill and the operation, although more important is survival, making it through another attack and somehow avoiding exploding bombs. Mr. Nolan¡¯s emphasis on the visceral reality of Dunkirk leaves much unsaid; even in some opening explanatory text, the enemy isn¡¯t identified as Nazi Germany. The soldiers, of course, know exactly who they are fighting and perhaps even why, but in the field the enemy is finally the unnamed stranger trying to kill them. The soldier who scrambles over the gate and onto the beach is called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) in the credits, but I don¡¯t remember hearing or reading his name. Mostly, I just thought of him as Our Boy, less because of his youth than because of the vulnerability communicated through Mr. Whitehead¡¯s slight figure and tangible physical performance, his small and large gestures and moves: the darting, panicked eyes; the nervous, abrupt gestures; the hunched shoulders. In time, Tommy is joined by other soldiers waiting and running and ducking on the beach, the most important played by the equally fine Aneurin Barnard and the singer Harry Styles.Mr. Nolan¡¯s unyielding emphasis on the soldiers ¡ª and on war as it is experienced rather than on how it is strategized ¡ª blurs history even as it brings the present and its wars startlingly into view. ¡°Dunkirk¡± is a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday¡¯s fights and today¡¯s. Mr. Nolan closes that distance cinematically with visual sweep and emotional intimacy, with images of warfare and huddled, frightened survivors that together with Hans Zimmer¡¯s score reverberate through your body. By the time that plane is burning ¡ª and a young man is looking searchingly into the future ¡ª you are reminded that the fight against fascism continues.",0.999074015333797,"Action"

The more famous and successful comics tend to be better psychologically armored than the others. Jamie Foxx says having a lot of money can cushion the pain of a poorly received performance. But the overall mood of this film, which is more downbeat than some might expect, is anxious, combative and at times self-pitying. Failure is always a possibility, and it is accompanied by the terrifying sensation that one comic describes as falling and never landing.

Still, it would not be entirely unfair to note that his best-known films of this century are portraits of major historical figures ¡ª specifically, two United States secretaries of defense. ¡°The Fog of War,¡± in 2003, featured the ruminations of Robert S. McNamara, who oversaw a large part of the Vietnam War, while ¡°The Unknown Known,¡± in 2013, examined Donald H. Rumsfeld and his part in the war in Iraq.¡°The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman¡¯s Portrait Photography,¡± Mr. Morris¡¯s new film, is a feature of modest length on a subject of seemingly modest import, particularly relative to those other movies. It begins with Ms. Dorfman herself, puttering among her files of photographs (and the documentary stays with her in this room for about 75 percent of its running time); she speaks at first of a large portrait of her husband, and the fluorescent vest she has sewn on his overcoat (he¡¯s wearing it in the picture) to keep him visible when he walks through streets at night while running errands. If you didn¡¯t know anything about Ms. Dorfman, who¡¯s 80, you might initially take her for a nice old lady with an unusual hobby ¡ª someone akin to the American eccentrics Mr. Morris portrayed in his early features, such as ¡°Vernon, Florida¡± and ¡°Gates of Heaven.¡±But you would be wrong, and this is part of the point that Mr. Morris makes, quietly, with this enjoyable but also profound movie. Part of Mr. Morris¡¯s reputation as a great documentary filmmaker is derived from his friendly-seeming but pressing interview technique, but here, when he¡¯s heard, he speaks to Ms. Dorfman as a friend, and she responds to him with warm reminiscences of her beginnings as a photographer.She speaks of living in New York City in the late ¡¯50s as a single woman, and of working as a secretary at the publisher Grove Press, where she met the poet Allen Ginsberg, a lifelong friend. She relocated to Cambridge, Mass., and worked at Grolier Poetry Bookshop, all the while snapping pictures of the luminaries she met there and, perhaps more crucially, of herself and her home life. In 1974 she published ¡°Elsa¡¯s Housebook ¡ª A Woman¡¯s Photojournal,¡± a milestone in both American photography and feminist art. Eventually, a combination of luck and persistence led to her setting up a portrait studio equipped with a Polaroid camera that produced 20-inch-by-24-inch prints. Because of the nature of the instantly developing film, Ms. Dorfman would take only two shots of her customers, and allow them to choose which one they wanted to leave with. She kept the other ¡ª hence the movie¡¯s title. Mr. Morris made this portrait in the aftermath of Polaroid¡¯s discontinuation of its large-format film and Ms. Dorfman¡¯s subsequent retirement. ¡°Elsa, do you think the camera tells the truth?¡± he asks. ¡°Absolutely not,¡± she says with a laugh. Later, though, as she pauses in her descriptions of the pictures she pulls from her files, she speaks of ¡°how many people are dead, and how many people struggled,¡± and you can feel how her work has revealed some truths about that.Ms. Dorfman emerges as an artist of deep compassion, empathy, humor and wisdom. During a montage of photographs of Ginsberg, he is heard in a late-¡¯50s audio recording reading his great poem ¡°America.¡± Lines like ¡°America when will you end the human war¡± and ¡°America why are your libraries full of tears¡± resonate with a particular poignancy even today, as does ¡°America when will you be angelic.¡± ¡°The B-Side¡± is a portrait of a genuine American angel.",0.991075096832653,"Documentary"

In addition to directing midnight-movie classics like ¡°El Topo¡± and ¡°The Holy Mountain,¡± he has composed music and written many books. He is an expert on the tarot and psychotherapy. But in his two recent autobiographical films ¡ª ¡°The Dance of Reality¡± and now ¡°Endless Poetry¡± ¡ª Mr. Jodorowsky, at 88, shows the irrepressible energy of a man who is just getting started.The main character in ¡°Endless Poetry¡± is exactly that: a 20-ish Alejandro (played by the director¡¯s son Adan) discovering his literary vocation in Chile in the late 1940s. Burning with ambition and existential hunger, Alejandro makes his way through bohemian Santiago, collecting friends, lovers, mentors and muses among the city¡¯s artists and writers. Some of their names ¡ª Nicanor Parra, Stella D¨ªaz Var¨ªn and Enrique Lihn ¡ª can be found in the annals of 20th-century Chilean literature. Along with Pablo Larra¨ªn¡¯s ¡°Neruda,¡± this film would be a useful assignment in an introductory course on the subject.Not that there is anything remotely dry or academic about Mr. Jodorowsky¡¯s approach to the story of his own life. ¡°I¡¯m going to save Surrealism,¡± his younger self declares, and ¡°Endless Poetry¡± makes good on that vow with a barrage of improbable situations and bizarre, sometimes grotesque images. The most surreal effect may be the casting. Mr. Jodorowsky in his present gray-bearded state shows up to narrate, and in addition to Adan, another son, Brontis, appears onscreen, reprising the role of Alejandro¡¯s bullying, insecure father, which he played in ¡°The Dance of Reality.¡±That film was infused with the wonders and terrors of childhood, and was a tour de force of Freudian mischief and Felliniesque nostalgia. ¡°Endless Poetry,¡± telling a more diffuse story, doesn¡¯t reach quite the same level of intensity, but it is testament to the relentless energy and undimmed ingenuity of its creator and a moving defense of the prerogatives of the imagination. Realism is not on the agenda, but Mr. Jodorowsky nonetheless evokes the chaotic, passionate spirit of a time and offers astute insights into his own psychology. He uses masquerade, puppetry, theatrical lighting and set design and the luridly expressive cinematography of the great Christopher Doyle to create a world of hallucinatory artifice. Alejandro¡¯s mother, Sara, who sings all her dialogue in fluting operatic tones, is played by Pamela Flores, who also plays Stella, the young poet¡¯s beer-drinking, cigar-smoking protector and sort-of lover. This doubling is mirrored by the resemblance between Adan Jodorowsky and Leandro Taub, who plays Alejandro¡¯s pal and sort-of rival Enrique Lihn.For all of these characters, poetry is fundamentally a sensual undertaking, and Mr. Jodorowsky is a voracious poet of the flesh. It¡¯s too easy to describe his interest in unusually large and small bodies, in wounded and painted skin, in amputation and contortion as perverse, freakish or provocative. That language belongs to the patriarchal world of propriety and repression, against which Alejandro¡¯s life is one long protest. The images in ¡°Endless Poetry¡± are arresting and sometimes disturbing, but there is an earnest commitment to ecstasy and authenticity that renders moot any question of offensiveness or exploitation.Coherence may also be beside the point. ¡°Endless Poetry¡± is never boring, but it has a tendency to meander and repeat itself. Mr. Jodorowsky is a poet in the broadest sense, a restless artist whose temperament isn¡¯t wedded to any particular form. He seems to embrace cinema out of convenience. He can¡¯t beam his visions directly into your brain, or tattoo his words on your body, but this is the next best thing.",0.985832627114215,"Biography"

In narration, Mr. Clapton talks of being practically mesmerized by music by African-American musicians he heard on the radio as a child.

Music helped him cope with, or at least mentally escape, a confusing home life, one in which he initially believed his mother was an older sister.Ms. Zanuck takes an unusual approach to the music documentary. She has no talking-head interviews; the visual component is entirely composed of archival footage, of either the still or moving-picture variety. Interviewees are tagged with onscreen titles.

But it apparently took a writer as terrible as E L James, the author of the ¡°Fifty Shades¡± series, to really hit the commercial sweet spot. The result is a clutch of best sellers, a hit movie (based on the first book, ¡°Fifty Shades of Grey¡±) and now a sequel, ¡°Fifty Shades Darker,¡± that¡¯s almost bad enough to recommend.Well, not quite, though it¡¯s always instructive to watch how many different ways one movie can go wrong and to guess what happened between a first feature and a second. For all its flaws, ¡°Fifty Shades of Grey¡± had a competent director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, who mostly wrung a watchable movie out of the material, partly by letting lightness and laughter in. It also had a natural star in Dakota Johnson, one of those unforced charmers who can deliver bad lines so gracefully that, after a while, you don¡¯t much care about their quality. With low-key charisma, she drew you toward her, so that your attention and hopes fell on her instead of the nonsense surrounding her. She was a stealth weapon.

He¡¯s a professional with real credits, so I assume that he¡¯s not finally responsible for the ineptitude of ¡°Fifty Shades Darker,¡± which ranges from continuity issues to unsurprisingly risible writing. There are also abrupt swings in tone, dead-end detours and flatline performances, including from Ms. Johnson. The sex is strained and certainly seems to burn serious calories (Christian flips Anastasia like a pancake), but finally pales next to the commodity fetishism. The use of Ben and Jerry¡¯s vanilla ice cream, however, made for great product placement.There¡¯s not much else to say except that the all-media screening of ¡°Fifty Shades Darker¡± I attended had scarcely begun before it turned into a live edition of the TV show ¡°Mystery Science Theater 3000.¡± At least some of the few hundred moviegoers seem to have arrived with modest expectations; others had seen ¡°Fifty Shades of Grey,¡± so presumably knew better.

She has made an engrossing, dynamically shot movie that moves with real fluidity and complexity. Yet she also succumbs to familiar ideological pitfalls. The standard complaints about cultural appropriation, point of view and the ethics of aestheticizing war all apply.The movie¡¯s source is Loung Ung¡¯s 2000 memoir of her childhood under the Khmer Rouge, which captured Phnom Penh when she was 5 and ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. Ms. Jolie announces her respect for the material almost immediately by putting the titles in Khmer as well as in English, only to undercut that gesture with a slick, scene-setting montage, glibly scored to the Rolling Stones¡¯ ¡°Sympathy for the Devil.¡± The sequence juxtaposes footage of Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and others with imagery of the United States¡¯ bombing raids in Cambodia.Still, the stab at an energetic overture isn¡¯t totally unwelcome, since the previous war movies Ms. Jolie directed ¡ª ¡°In the Land of Blood and Honey¡± (2011) and ¡°Unbroken¡± (2014) ¡ª were both earnest slogs. ¡°First They Killed My Father¡± is never that. The story proper begins in Phnom Penh, where the young Loung (Sreymoch Sareum) lives comfortably with her middle-class family, which is loyal to the outgoing government. Her father (Kompheak Phoeung) is a captain in the military police. A moment in which Loung reaches for the sky, trying to touch a helicopter overhead, recalls Steven Spielberg¡¯s ¡°Empire of the Sun,¡± a movie that, with its child¡¯s-eye view of war as a time of horror and wonder, might well have served as a template. The screenplay ¡ª Ms. Jolie and Ms. Ung are credited as a writing team ¡ª manages the tricky task of providing enough information to push the film along while only rarely straying beyond what a child might comprehend. Loung soon discovers that she and her family, with whom she¡¯s been forced to evacuate the capital, won¡¯t be returning home after the promised three days. She learns that she will work in service of Angkar (the name for the Khmer Rouge leadership); surrender personal property (foreign goods, in particular, are seen as symbols of an imperialist agenda); and be separated piecemeal from her parents and siblings.Ms. Jolie sparked an outcry for a casting process that, as recounted in a Vanity Fair interview, struck many as exploitative. The article said that Ms. Jolie was looking for children who had experienced hardship, and that for the lead role, the casting directors created a game in which children would steal money off a table and then lie when caught. (Ms. Jolie said her quotations were taken out of context; Vanity Fair stood by the story.) Whatever her process, she has found an expressive star in Ms. Sareum, who carries much of the film without words.Whether the movie¡¯s perspective is truly Loung¡¯s is another matter. Ms. Jolie, working with the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, shoots the character¡¯s dream sequences in garish, supersaturated colors. The elaborate Steadicam shots and pervasive images of light streaming through foliage seem incongruously punch-drunk for a film that concerns mass starvation and death. Even a moment in which children training to fight stand completely still in a murky river during a downpour seems conceived more for its compositional possibilities than dramatic effect. Viewers familiar with the work of one of the producers, Rithy Panh, a director who has made movies about his own youth under the Khmer Rouge (including ¡°The Missing Picture¡±), may find the rampant prettification poorly considered.The most simultaneously stunning and appalling shot shows a high-angle view of Loung treading carefully through a mine-strewn forest as another woman runs through it ¡ª only to step on a mine and be killed.

I was in a pretty foul mood when I went to see ¡°Fist Fight.¡± It was Wednesday. It was February. It was 2017. And while I can¡¯t exactly say that the movie cheered me up, it did give me something I needed. Not catharsis or uplift but a bracing dose of profane, sloppy, reasonably well-directed hostility. We take what we can get.The movie, directed by Richie Keen from a script by Van Robichaux and Evan Susser, breaks no new ground. It¡¯s a bad-teacher comedy about a school staffed with stock figures played by reliable performers. There¡¯s a grouchy principal (Dean Norris), a horny guidance counselor (Jillian Bell), a dweeby security guard (Kumail Nanjiani), a nutty football coach (Tracy Morgan) and a femme fatale French instructor (Christina Hendricks). They provide a Greek chorus of goofiness behind the main conflict, which is between Mr. Campbell (Charlie Day), an anxious English teacher, and his profoundly irritable colleague, Mr. Strickland (Ice Cube), whose subject is history. Ice Cube brings his own history to the project, at one point quoting a famously inflammatory N.W.A lyric and glancing back to the days when, as one of my colleagues put it, ¡°everyone was scared¡± of him. Campbell certainly is, especially after a series of misunderstandings leads Strickland to challenge him to the after-school face-off that gives the movie its name. A bit of context: It¡¯s the last day of school, and the seniors are pulling pranks ¡ª involving a horse, paintball guns and a lot of penis graffiti ¡ª at the Atlanta high school where the two adversaries work. This provides an extra dollop of slapstick chaos, but the kids are peripheral to the movie¡¯s main interest, which is in the mismatch and implicit bromance between Ice Cube and Mr. Day. Each one does what he¡¯s expected to do. Mr. Day twitches and babbles and blinks his eyes rapidly. Ice Cube bellows and glowers and doesn¡¯t blink at all.There is an obvious racial dimension to their conflict, though ¡°Fist Fight¡± tiptoes around it, winking and whispering, with typical big-studio timidity. (The most recent season of the HBO comedy ¡°Vice Principals¡± came closer to touching the hot core of resentment in a Southern public school setting.) And it is certainly possible to interpret this movie as yet another fable of a white man¡¯s redemption at the hands (or fists, as the case may be) of a black man. We know that Campbell has a young daughter (Alexa Nisenson) and a pregnant wife (JoAnna Garcia Swisher). We learn nothing at all about Strickland, except that he is the subject of wild legends among the student body. His job in the movie is to teach Campbell some hard lessons about being a man.All of which is fairly tiresome. But it¡¯s also possible to read ¡°Fist Fight¡± against the interracial buddy-movie grain, seeing Strickland rather than Campbell as the protagonist, and taking Strickland¡¯s anger as a principled response to circumstances rather than as evidence of a mood disorder. The big fight takes place against a background of layoffs and budget cuts. The teachers are harassed by the students and undermined by the administration, yet they persist in the work of education. Strickland is an agent not of guilty racial fear but of righteous class consciousness. The lesson he imparts to Campbell is one of public-sector workers¡¯ solidarity. By all evidence, he¡¯s a pretty good teacher, with good reason to stay mad. Which cheered me up, I must say.",0.800154686378572,"Comedy"

Still, it has a problem endemic to film books: It lacks clips.So perhaps ¡°Five Came Back¡± was destined to become a Netflix series. Divided into three parts, this screen adaptation is a companion piece and a stand-alone work, and itself superlative film criticism. Directed by Laurent Bouzereau, ¡°Five Came Back¡± will be shown theatrically in New York and Los Angeles starting Friday, when it also begins streaming on Netflix.Sidestepping the impossible task of compression, this chronological series takes the gambit of having each director¡¯s story relayed by a contemporary counterpart. The pairings aren¡¯t always the expected ones.Steven Spielberg, whose own movies share obvious affinities with those of Frank Capra and John Ford, is the surrogate for William Wyler. Mr. Spielberg¡¯s eye is one of the series¡¯ strongest assets: He extols the aerial photography in ¡°The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress¡± (1944), an account of a B-17 bomber¡¯s mission, and later notes how Wyler avoided camera motion until a crucial scene in ¡°The Best Years of Our Lives¡± (1946), one of several postwar films held up as examples of how the directors¡¯ experiences overseas transformed their movies. The explication of Frank Capra falls to Guillermo del Toro, who shares insights into Capra¡¯s populism, his immigrant¡¯s can-do mentality and his shrewdness as an entertainer. Paul Greengrass, no stranger to drama in the air (¡°United 93¡±) or on the sea (¡°Captain Phillips¡±), seems to understand Ford intuitively. Of Ford¡¯s documentary ¡°The Battle of Midway¡± (1942), he notes the dangerousness of the camera placement and moments when violence visibly distresses the image. Francis Ford Coppola defends John Huston¡¯s use of staging in ¡°The Battle of San Pietro¡± (1945) as potentially capturing the essence of the situation more completely than straight documenting might have.With its use of archival clips, men talking into the camera and narration by Meryl Streep, ¡°Five Came Back¡± might seem like standard documentary filmmaking. But it¡¯s easy to overlook the complexity of its editing, which distills a trove of footage in superbly illustrative ways.Of the wartime directors, George Stevens, whose story is told by Lawrence Kasdan, arguably has the spottiest critical reputation, and he vanishes for long stretches of ¡°Five Came Back¡± until his teaming with John Ford to film the D-Day invasion.But if you were to watch ¡°Five Came Back¡± with the sound off, the shots that might most catch your eye are Stevens¡¯s extraordinary images of the liberated streets of France and of the horrors of the Dachau concentration camp. His subsequent film version of ¡°The Diary of Anne Frank¡± (1959), sometimes ridiculed for its counterintuitive use of CinemaScope and the casting of the model Millie Perkins, may be the movie that gains most in retroactive inflections.Above all, ¡°Five Came Back¡± is an invitation to see more: It¡¯s hard to watch it without wanting to visit (or revisit) Wyler¡¯s ¡°Mrs. Miniver¡± or Ford¡¯s ¡°They Were Expendable.¡± It¡¯s further proof, if any were needed, that these men weren¡¯t simply creating propaganda, but art that would endure.",0.998482331696668,"Documentary"

With ¡°Flatliners,¡± Columbia Pictures takes a bold, innovative step to address this issue.It¡¯s startling in its simplicity. The well-known 1990 movie being remade here is something other than beloved, or classic. Rather it is remembered as a widely-derided post-Brat Pack ensemble piece. (And while the movie was indeed largely derided, The New York Times gave it a positive review, as did the critic Roger Ebert.) The potential for accusations of sacrilege is minimal.The original ¡°Flatliners,¡± directed by Joel Schumacher from a script by Peter Filardi, teamed the newly minted Julia Roberts with the lesser-known peers Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and Billy Baldwin in an underbaked story of medical students in the grip of a literally morbid obsession. Intent on exploring life after death, they temporarily put themselves into the uncharted territory of brain death (hence the title), with what were supposedly scary side effects relating to the wreckages of their past. Mr. Schumacher¡¯s movie is more a failed tone poem than a horror picture, and to its credit, this new version, with a trickier script by Ben Ripley and hyper-competent direction from the Swedish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev improves on it ¡ª by making it behave like a horror movie every now and then.Still. As much as I try not to outsmart the movies I watch, when this one opened with a color-desaturated scene of Ellen Page driving a car with a young girl in the passenger seat, the devil on my shoulder said, ¡°There is going to be a terrible accident, the girl is going to die, and this will spur the Ellen Page character into exploring the afterlife.¡± I was right. This set the tone for much of the rest of my viewing.Mr. Sutherland shows up here, but he doesn¡¯t reprise his irresponsible character from the first movie; he is a supervisor to the five medical students having after-death adventures, each one a particular type (There¡¯s James Norton¡¯s playboy, Nina Dobrev¡¯s alpha, Kiersey Clemons¡¯s striver and Diego Luna¡¯s Diego Luna), saddled with guilt that haunts them despite their near-death experiences also turning them into super-geniuses.This film did not screen for critics, nor was it previewed in New York theaters on a Thursday night, as is usually customary with studio pictures.

The real-life subject is now 81 years old, whippet-thin, and a storyteller and self-examiner of no small gifts.Whenever Mr. Serpico appears in this admiring film, directed by Antonino D¡¯Ambrosio, the movie lights up. ¡°I told myself I was an actor,¡± he says into a mirror onscreen, describing how he would work himself up before hitting the streets to make arrests. He recalls, speaking from the restaurant in Brooklyn that used to be his father¡¯s shoe-repair store, how even in childhood his admiration for police work was mitigated by experience. Once, he says, a uniformed officer came into the place, got a shoeshine from Frank, who was then a child, and left without paying.

It¡¯s one thing to read about roundups of suspected illegal immigrants; it¡¯s quite another to observe the anxiety of smart, talented teenagers trying to keep their cool while under the watchful gaze of immigration officials and the police.In his director¡¯s statement, Mr. Newton declares that he didn¡¯t set out to make a political film. But recent government actions lend a painful urgency to these interwoven stories. With the fear of deportation hanging over their heads, these adolescents are forced to weigh major life decisions at an age when their American-born peers are fretting about the already stressful challenges of dating and getting into college.¡°From Nowhere¡± focuses on three promising students whose caring teacher Jackie (Julianne Nicholson) has arranged for them to meet with an immigration lawyer (Denis O¡¯Hare) who is working pro bono to help them achieve political asylum before they graduate. To bolster their cases, he asks them to supply detailed evidence of the horrors they fled. Asylum is more likely to be granted if their histories involved genocide, genital mutilation or a dictatorship.The most promising student is Moussa (J. Mallory McCree), whose frightened mother (Chinasa Ogbuagu) brought the family from Guinea to the United States to live with a man who subsequently abandoned them. Now the family is behind in the rent and facing eviction. Bitter, cynical Sophie (Octavia Chavez-Richmond) is from the Dominican Republic and lives with an uncle who treats her as a household slave in an extended family where he resents her presence (another mouth to feed). Because his beer-drinking buddies make surreptitious passes at her when they come over to watch sports, she trusts no one, and her rage threatens to boil over. Her defensive hauteur leads her fellow students to think she is crazy.The bright, peppy, Peruvian-born Alyssa (Raquel Castro), the class valedictorian, has the most difficulty compiling evidence for the lawyer, and is also the least developed character.The tensions among these boisterous teenagers are palpable in scenes of their being stopped on the street at night by the police and interrogated, and at a post-prom party that threatens to erupt into a brawl. Even among the faculty members, the atmosphere is so tense that Jackie is taken aside by a superior and questioned about her possibly inappropriate relationship with Moussa.¡°From Nowhere¡± culminates in a celebratory graduation ceremony. But by this time excruciating choices have been made, and the uncertain future of a student who chooses to leave the country gives the film an underlying sadness. Their ordeal feels cruel, unnecessary and infuriatingly real.¡°How could I think I had anything to teach these kids about reality?¡± a disheartened Jackie muses in a final conversation with the lawyer, during which she learns which student has the best chance of receiving asylum. ¡°They could teach me about reality.¡±",0.911551828337651,"Drama"

Besides baring a heretofore-unseen part of her artistic soul, the movie finds her coping with heartache and physical ailments.

Stone Jr., the subject and star of ¡°Get Me Roger Stone,¡± struts through this documentary with peacock feathers fully fanned. He¡¯s first heard from a perch in some luxury digs, dressed in a tailored chalk-stripe suit with an olive martini at the ready. ¡°My name is Roger Stone,¡± he says, ¡°and I¡¯m an agent provocateur.¡± The scene suggests James Bond cosplay, although it¡¯s worth mentioning that the definition of an agent provocateur isn¡¯t a supercool British fantasy spy but someone who persuades others to do wrong.So, who is Mr. Stone persuading? It¡¯s an inevitable question given his relationship with President Trump and how Mr. Stone¡¯s name just keeps popping up in the news churn. In a May 5 article in The New York Times, for starters, Mr. Stone confirmed that he was one of what the report called ¡°high-profile Trump campaign associates¡± who¡¯d been asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee ¡°to hand over emails and other records of dealings with Russians as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election.¡± Mr. Stone said that he was ¡°eager, indeed anxious, to testify in full public session, have requested no immunity and am ready to go.¡±Skip to this Tuesday, when President Trump fired James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., noting his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton¡¯s use of a private email server. Mr. Stone, 64, a giddily freewheeling Twitter user, greeted this news with a series of tweets, including one with a GIF of Mr. Trump stamped ¡°You¡¯re Fired!¡± and another that reads ¡°Somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling.¡± On Wednesday, CNN reported that Mr. Stone had recommended that Mr. Trump fire Mr. Comey. The president responded via Twitter: Whatever else, this is killer timing for Netflix, which is releasing ¡°Get Me Roger Stone¡± on Friday in theaters and via streaming. That¡¯s especially true because in any other year and perhaps under any other administration, this documentary ¡ª the directors are Daniel DiMauro, Dylan Bank and Morgan Pehme ¡ª might have disappeared into the ether. But topicality is all or at least a large part of the movie¡¯s draw. A sometimes illuminating, often slapdash and frustrating affair that mixes on-the-scenes bits, found material and original interviews (with the likes of Jeffrey Toobin), it opens with Mr. Trump accepting the presidential nomination in July 2016 and ends soon after his election. Much of the rest is a chronological march through Mr. Stone¡¯s life, which is studded with scandal and boldfaced names like Roy Cohn. As it maps the road to Trumpville, the movie offers glimpses of Mr. Stone¡¯s youth, including an oft-repeated story about a light-bulb encounter with Barry Goldwater¡¯s book ¡°The Conscience of a Conservative.¡± An ideological true believer is born who backs legal pot and has a few Nixon-theme bongs that he likes to show off along with his other Nixonian paraphernalia. After a brush with Watergate, Mr. Stone pokes around here and there; works for both of Ronald Reagan¡¯s presidential campaigns; and helps establish a firm that grew into Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, one of a number of companies that earned the nickname ¡°the torturers¡¯ lobby¡± for repping countries condemned as human-rights abusers.The documentary also sketches a political family tree that could be its own movie and that has Cohn, the chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy, at its head and branches out to include Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump. Mr. Stone wasn¡¯t yet 30 when he met Cohn in 1979. (At the time, Mr. Stone was helping to run Reagan¡¯s presidential campaign.) Cohn served as Mr. Trump¡¯s lawyer for years and, by many accounts, assumed the role of mentor. It was Cohn who introduced Mr. Stone to Mr. Trump; Mr. Stone decided that Mr. Trump was presidential material and, years later, has become identified as one of the president¡¯s outside advisers.The movie spends considerable time tagging after the fast-moving Mr. Stone, tracking him from event to event, car to home to microphone, as when he swans into an outdoor rally during the 2016 Republican National Convention that registers as pro-Trump, though perhaps more anti-Clinton. There are signs and people milling about wearing shirts emblazoned with the words ¡°Hillary for Prison¡±; for his part, the uncharacteristically underdressed Mr. Stone seems almost naked in a T-shirt with Bill Clinton¡¯s smiling likeness and the word ¡°rape.¡± The movie doesn¡¯t at this point identify Alex Jones, the radio host and conspiracy theorist (the ¡°Pizzagate¡± hoax), who can be seen hovering at Mr. Stone¡¯s side.Mr. Jones isn¡¯t formally identified until well into the movie, a careless, exasperating decision. Like other documentaries, this one crams found footage into punchy montage sequences held together by (not always identified) voice-overs. The problem with this clip-art approach is that it tends to turn history into cultural wallpaper, as in the section featuring images of the unnamed Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who ¡ª with the help of Roy Cohn ¡ª were executed in 1953 after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage. In other areas, the lack of specificity raises questions that remain unanswered, as when an image of the Pentagon flashes by without explanation.Movies about colorful characters, be they saints or sinners, are often hijacked by their subject, so it¡¯s unsurprising that Mr. Stone, with his bespoke suits and Nixon tattoo, owns this one from the get-go. An energetic tour guide and three-ring circus of one, he seems happiest in front of the camera, which in turn eagerly laps him up. It¡¯s a familiar interdependency and, at times, this movie suggests that his most obvious talent is for self-promotion, one that¡¯s been aided by the attention of the news media. Among the few journalists who seem to have really gotten under his thick skin was Wayne Barrett, an investigative reporter for The Village Voice who died in January. Mr. Stone has been providing journalists with copy for years. In 1985, Jacob Weisberg profiled him in The New Republic (¡°The State-of-the-Art Washington Sleazeball¡±), drawing a line from Mr. Stone¡¯s lobbying work to those Reagan aides ¡ª Lyn Nofziger, Michael Deaver, Lee Atwater and Ed Rollins ¡ª who ¡°have abandoned helping Reagan make conservative ideas reality in order to sell their connections to the highest bidders.¡± The journalist Jane Mayer (¡°Dark Money¡±) effectively picks up that same thread in the movie when she says, ¡°Lobbying had been considered kind of a sleazy business, but Roger Stone unabashedly came out and said, ¡®I¡¯m going to make a pile of money off of this and no apologies.¡¯¡±The indefatigable Mr. Stone continues to go go go, unapologetically. In January, he published his most recent book, ¡°The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution.¡± On Monday, Alliance Strategies Group announced that it would ¡°exclusively represent¡± Mr. Stone¡¯s online presence for ¡°digital advertising opportunities,¡± adding that he is ¡°most well-known as President Donald Trump¡¯s confidant and political adviser of over 40 years and often viewed as the architect of the Trump presidential strategy.¡±And on Friday, ¡°Get Me Roger Stone¡± will do its part to extend Mr. Stone¡¯s reach and his brand, both of which seem as unbounded as he does.",0.698478587657861,"Documentary"

The writer and director, Jordan Peele (of the comedy sketch show ¡°Key & Peele¡±), knows how to make shadowy streets into menacing ones and turn silences into warnings from the abyss. His greatest stroke in ¡°Get Out,¡± though, is to have hitched these genre elements to an evil that isn¡¯t obscured by a hockey mask, but instead throws open its arms with a warm smile while enthusiastically (and strangely) expressing its love for President Obama. Those arms and smiles all but engulf Chris (the British actor Daniel Kaluuya, going deep in a breakthrough performance), a photographer with a sweet pad, adorable dog and equally frisky, adoring girlfriend, Rose (a perfectly cast Allison Williams, from the HBO show ¡°Girls¡±). The story opens with them preparing for a long weekend with her parents. ¡°Do they know I¡¯m black?¡± Chris gently asks. They don¡¯t, but Rose assures him not to worry, and off they go into the countryside and narrative complications. Mr. Peele, making his feature debut, sets a cozy, innocuous scene complete with coos and loving glances, a tranquillity that shatters with an eerily inopportune deer crossing. By the time Chris and Rose pull up to her parents¡¯ house ¡ª a stately brick building with imposing white columns and rocking chairs on the front porch ¡ª ripples of unease have disturbed the calm. The nicer Rose¡¯s parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener), behave, the greater the ripples. They don¡¯t blink at him or his race (Ms. Keener is a virtuoso of the deadeye stare), but instead adopt the forced geniality of people who seem anxious to hide their discomfort. Missy¡¯s the watchful one, while the voluble Dean cozies up to Chris, dropping embarrassing slang and relating an odd story about Jesse Owens, the black Olympian who shocked Hitler.ImageMr. Kaluuya in ¡°Get Out.¡±CreditUniversal PicturesMr. Peele is best known for his work with Keegan-Michael Key on their titular comedy sketch show, where politics mixed freely with the laughs. Together they starred in the 2016 comedy ¡°Keanu,¡± a lampoon of action cinema that was a (slack) piece with the movie love that was a mainstay of their show. In one memorable bit from the show, heckling cinephiles voice their complaints (¡°this movie has an inconsistent visual language!¡±); in another, two friends realize that the reason the zombie hordes aren¡¯t attacking them is they¡¯re flesh-eating racists. ¡°Get Out¡± expands on, and considerably deepens, a similar idea by turning white racism into disquieting genre shivers.But Mr. Peele is after more than giggles and shocks; he¡¯s taking on 21st-century white racism and its rationales. The opener ¡ª a black man talking on a cellphone on an empty suburban street ¡ª briskly sets the tone, unsettles the mood and announces Mr. Peele¡¯s way with metaphor. He¡¯s working within a recognizable horror-film framework here (the darkness, the stillness), so it¡¯s not surprising when a car abruptly pulls up and begins tailing the man. You may even snicker because you think you¡¯ve seen this flick before. Except that when this man anxiously looks for a way out, the scene grows discordantly disturbing because you may, as I did, flash on Trayvon Martin. It¡¯s a jarring moment that might have been catastrophic for the movie if Mr. Peele didn¡¯t quickly yank you back into its fiction. (He¡¯s got great timing, no surprise.) There¡¯s relief when the offscreen world recedes just then. Yet part of what makes ¡°Get Out¡± both exciting and genuinely unsettling is how real life keeps asserting itself, scene after scene. Our monsters, Mr. Peele reminds us, are at times as familiar as the neighborhood watch; one person¡¯s fiction, after all, is another¡¯s true-life horror story. ¡± For his part, Chris, separated existentially, chromatically and every other way, spends so much time putting the white world at ease that he can¡¯t recognize the threat coming for him. Mr. Peele knows that threat, plays with it and eviscerates it with jokes and scares, only to top it off messily with full-on Grand Guignol splatter. But some of his finest, most genuinely shocking work is his quietest. One of the best scenes I¡¯ve seen in a long while finds Chris talking with one of the parents¡¯ black servants, a maid, Georgina (a fantastic Betty Gabriel). Chris confesses that he gets nervous when around a lot of white people, an admission that Georgina answers by advancing toward him with a volley of ¡°no, no, no,¡± cascades of tears and a smile so wide it looks as if it could split her face in two.

In the thrill-free science-fiction thriller ¡°Ghost in the Shell,¡± her character comes at you in pieces, emerging first during the opening credits in the form of a metallic skeleton. It¡¯s a good look ¡ª it evokes the original Terminator ¡ª but soon the skeleton is being dipped like a chip in whitish goo. This technological soup gives the metallic frame a humanoid cladding, making it more reassuringly and pleasantly familiar, from bosomy top to round bottom. It looks like a giant dream Barbie, hairless pubis and all. Enjoy these credits because they offer some of the more arresting, inventive images in this visually cluttered yet often disappointingly drab movie. A live-action version of a famed Japanese manga by Shirow Masamune, ¡°Ghost in the Shell¡± is one of those future-shock stories that edges around the dystopian without going full-bore apocalyptic. To that end it is set in a possible future world that looks distant enough to seem exotic and familiar enough to seem plausible. The original manga takes place in what¡¯s described as a ¡°strange corporate conglomerate-state called ¡®Japan,¡¯¡± while this movie unwinds nowhere in particular, just a universal megalopolis filled with soaring gray towers.Anyone who has seen Ridley Scott¡¯s ¡°Blade Runner¡± or that film¡¯s innumerable 2.0 follow-ups (¡°Strange Days,¡± ¡°The Fifth Element¡±) will recognize this ¡°Ghost¡± cityscape, with its jumbled forms, neo-noir shadows, patina of art-directed decay and its conspicuous Asian-Hollywood fusion touches. Some of this tickles the eye, like the semi-translucent, pony-size koi fish that float through the air, seemingly just because they look cool. The koi don¡¯t seem to be selling anything other than the movie¡¯s production values and visual concept; elsewhere, enormous spectral human figures loom over buildings like embodied billboards, nicely evoking rampaging movie monsters of the past. The most important leviathan, of course, is Ms. Johansson, whose mysterioso cyborg, Major, effortlessly slides right into this scene, with her preternaturally still face ¨C often as blank as a mask ¨C and the ports in the back of her neck that she uses to jack into cables and other characters. These artificial orifices are pleasingly mysterious and highly suggestive, at once creating a sense of human vulnerability and raising the possibility of the posthuman. Major occasionally stuffs goo in her ports and also uses them to plug into others. About the only part of her that¡¯s human is her soul, or ¡°ghost¡± in the story¡¯s poetic parlance. The rest of Major is a bendable, mendable shell, which makes her well suited for hard-core tactical work with a police outfit known as Section 9. As the title suggests, ¡°Ghost in the Shell¡± is haunted, including by the original manga, its sequels and several excellent animated movies: the first, also titled ¡°Ghost in the Shell,¡± and the entrancingly lovely ¡°Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence,¡± both directed by Mamoru Oshii. The new ¡°Ghost in the Shell¡± was directed by Rupert Sanders, who has made commercials and one other feature, ¡°Snow White and the Huntsman.¡± He likes a dark palette and is good with actors, but there¡¯s little here that feels personal, and he mostly functions as a blockbuster traffic cop, managing all the busily moving, conspicuously pricey parts.That¡¯s too bad, especially because the original ¡°Ghost in the Shell¡± is such a delightful philosophical plaything, with pleasures that simultaneously bewitch the eye and enchant the mind. This version, by contrast, ditches the original¡¯s big, human, all-too-human questions, but keeps all the firing guns and car chases, the action clich¨¦s and intentional genre stereotypes. Stripped of its deeper-dish musings, the story turns into a perfectly watchable, somewhat bland action movie, tricked out with sharp details, some fine actors and one slumming legend, the director-actor Takeshi Kitano, who plays Aramaki, Major¡¯s boss. He only speaks in Japanese; Major and almost everyone else speak in English.The characters understand one another, presumably because they¡¯re beyond mere language and, in any event, they sometimes communicate telepathically. At first, the fact that they can speak to one another comes across as an inventive flourish, but like so much in ¡°Ghost in the Shell¡± ¡ª the toddling geishas, the Asian extras ¡ª it helps to reduce an entire culture to a decorative detail. The movie has been widely criticized for casting Ms. Johansson in a role that was, of course, originally Japanese, a decision that isn¡¯t offset by an absurd narrative twist that seems to have been created to forestall criticism but will only provoke further ire.

There she co-starred as a wisecracking comedy writer on ¡°The Dick Van Dyke Show,¡± and later for many years on ¡°Hollywood Squares.¡± In between the successes of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, Rose Marie, this movie argues, was one of the most important female comic voices in America.Carl Reiner and Mr. Van Dyke provide colorful personal testimony about working with her ¡ª and Dan Harmon, the creator of ¡°Community,¡± displays an insightful critic¡¯s eye ¡ª but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage. Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection.Jason Wise¡¯s documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked. Her single-minded focus on work is presented as admirable but also something of a curse. As in the documentary ¡°Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,¡± this is a movie about a star never at peace unless she¡¯s performing, a contrast with ¡°Gilbert,¡± another compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic. The stand-up comic Gilbert Gottfried has built a highly respected career telling profane, even shocking jokes in a sandpaper voice. The director Neil Berkeley nicely sketches his career with an emphasis on controversial comedy. (¡°I have a flight to California,¡± he said at a roast weeks after Sept. 11. ¡°I can¡¯t get a direct flight. They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first.¡±)What distinguishes this documentary is the incongruity between the raucousness of the humor and the quiet, mundane rituals of his domestic life, whether puttering around his New York apartment or in more joyous scenes with his two children and wife, Dara Gottfried.As an unlikely love story, this movie excels, presenting a relationship so affectionate and warm that it overwhelms the jokes. When he curses at his wife, she takes it as a sweet nothing. And when she cracks a joke, he¡¯s quick with a booming laugh. ¡°Gilbert¡± is that rarest of things, a portrait of a happy comic.",0.99144626787375,"Documentary"

In the 1930s, runaway brides ran amok with banter and high jinks; in the 1940s, femmes fatales did their men wrong with lipstick sneers and a bullet to the heart. The latest iteration of this type of movie often skews comic and generally involves a group of gal pals getting together for some ¡°we time.¡± They find trouble and, here¡¯s hoping, their bliss amid oceans of booze and maybe drugs, sometimes in the company of men, who are alternately helpful or hapless.The affably amusing, sometimes spittingly funny comedy ¡°Girls Trip¡± recycles much of the same naughty women idea used and occasionally abused in movies like ¡°Bad Moms¡± and ¡°Sisters.¡± As in the recent ¡°Rough Night,¡± the women in ¡°Girls Trip¡± are old college friends who, after going down their respective paths, are reuniting for better and, at times, for worse. In ¡°Rough Night,¡± the regulation naughtiness ends up with the women, who are mostly white, accidentally (uh-oh) killing a man. That isn¡¯t on the menu for the black women in ¡°Girls Trip,¡± who, despite being fictional also exist in our world and so presumably would have a much harder time giggling their way out of spilling blood.That makes ¡°Girls Trip¡± seem tamer than a movie like ¡°Rough Night.¡± But ¡°Girls Trip¡± is also funnier; it¡¯s also more appealing because it knows that there¡¯s more at stake existentially for women, and especially for black women, than out-grossing men. The friends in ¡°Girls Trip¡± have other issues to work on, all of which are grounded in ordinary life: how to live in the world with love and joy, how to nurture intimate relationships so they don¡¯t slip away, how to balance professional and personal obligations without going nuts, how to perform fairly tricky sexual acts without embarrassing you or your partner right out of bed ¡ª you know, the usual.An invitation brings the friends and story in ¡°Girls Trip¡± together. It¡¯s sent by Ryan (Regina Hall), an entrepreneurial self-help guru who is rapidly heading toward Oprah-level celebrity. With a megawatt smile, an affirmation for every occasion and a beautiful husband by her side (a thankless role, capably handled by Mike Colter), Ryan seems to have it all. She¡¯s turned her life into a brand by selling other women on the idea that they can have it all, too, but now she¡¯s not so sure. After being tapped to speak at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, she invites three friends along for a weekend of sharing, caring and boozing, topped with guest turns from the likes of Common and Sean Combs. Enjoyment turns out to be contagious in ¡°Girls Trip,¡± which consistently manages to rework and even reinvigorate some severely worn-out conceits, setups and character types, mostly by complicating gender roles with class issues. The struggler is Sasha (Queen Latifah), a former serious journalist turned flailing gossip blogger; the wallflower, Lisa (Jada Pinkett Smith), is a nurse and single mom; the cutup, Dina (Tiffany Haddish), well, it¡¯s unclear what she does. She works, kind of, in an office or did ¡ª even her boss seems baffled about her status ¡ª but mostly Dina is the crazy snake in the can, the whoopee in the cushion and the movie¡¯s biggest, rowdiest laugh generator.The director Malcolm D. Lee (¡°The Best Man¡±) helps turn these types into characters efficiently and sympathetically ¡ª he knows how to light and frame a beautiful face ¡ª though every so often you sense he would like to cut loose visually. Mostly, he serves Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver¡¯s script, which goes high, low and sincere as it mixes some slapstick in with the sober bits, giddily indulges its freewheeling silliness and drops heart-to-hearts ranging from a sharply comic lesson on white privilege to a hilarious riff on the joys of grapefruit sex. (Ms. Oliver and Mr. Barris, who created the sitcom ¡°black-ish,¡± also wrote ¡°Barbershop: The Next Cut,¡± which Mr. Lee directed.)Like most movies of this comic ilk, including the male-centric ¡°Hangover¡± types, ¡°Girls Trip¡± is effectively a narrative striptease. Characters ¡ª mostly ordinary, straight, middle-class types ¡ª take some of it off, the ¡°it¡± being the cultural and social norms that define and often restrict them: the veneer of respectability, the accommodating smiles, the regulation control. At times this involves female characters testing, gingerly if fleetingly, the limits of that construct called femininity. ¡°Girls Trip¡± adds complexity to the picture by bringing in class, even as it dispatches with whiteness, showing it the door so that these women can find themselves while rediscovering the power and pleasures of sisterhood.",0.901928098168842,"Comedy"

Swaybacked and paunchy, with a thinning dome and an appetite for Winstons and Seagram¡¯s that would keep both brands in business if the rest of the world went cold turkey, Kenny doesn¡¯t quite have the wolfish charisma or the mystical intensity of some of Mr. McConaughey¡¯s other recent characters.

Mr. McConaughey is a ball of profane, entrepreneurial energy bouncing around in a vacuum. The story swings from the Nevada desert to the Indonesian rain forest to Wall Street boardrooms, and the screen bristles with signifiers of capitalist activity: meetings, phone calls, stock tickers. But the movie isn¡¯t really doing any work. It¡¯s just looking busy. Having nearly run the family prospecting business into the ground (so to speak), Kenny gambles on the expertise of a Mike Acosta (¨¦dgar Ram¨ªrez), a geologist with an almost mystical reputation. They strike gold in Indonesia, and a gilded future opens up for Kenny and his longtime girlfriend, Kaylene (Bryce Dallas Howard). There are shadows and complications, of course, including the corruptions of wealth, the treachery of rivals and Kenny¡¯s own impulsiveness. Broad hints are dropped that things will end badly. But enough goes wrong along the way ¡ª with the movie, I mean, not with Mike and Kenny¡¯s scheme ¡ª to make the outcome feel almost moot. The film is well cast: You can¡¯t really go wrong with Bill Camp, Corey Stoll, Stacy Keach and Bruce Greenwood. It¡¯s beautifully shot (you can¡¯t go wrong with Robert Elswit, either). There is a pleasingly sleazy, swaggering, brown-tinted ¡¯80s vibe.

It tries, in its frantic, clumsy fashion, to be all of those things, and comes close enough to succeeding to qualify as an honorable failure.What holds your attention is the question of whether that description fits Kenny as well. He could just as well be the opposite ¡ª a dishonorable success. He is far from a subtle guy, but Mr. McConaughey is a sly enough actor to make us wonder whether we¡¯re in the company of a fool or a con artist and to make us question whether there¡¯s really a difference.

Motivated by a volatile mix of desperation and bravado, he involves Nick in a poorly planned, haphazardly executed bank robbery. You can bet money on a disastrous outcome, though you might not foresee the precise sequence of mayhem and farce that unfolds on the streets of Queens over a single freezing night. The caper includes an after-hours visit to an amusement park, a soda bottle full of LSD, a case of mistaken identity and plenty of chases, beatings and narrow escapes.The Safdies are as clever and crafty as Connie is inept and impulsive. ¡°Good Time,¡± their third co-directed fictional feature ¡ª after the autobiographical ¡°Daddy Longlegs¡± and the addiction romance ¡°Heaven Knows What¡± ¡ª moves smartly and propulsively to the stressed-out strains of Daniel Lopatin¡¯s edge-of-a-heart-attack score. The smudgy, grimy urban landscape ¡ª emergency rooms, fast-food restaurants, blocks of modest, over-mortgaged, squeezed-together houses ¡ª is shot (by Sean Price Williams) with a fastidious avoidance of prettiness. The story doesn¡¯t twist and turn so much as squirm and jump like an eel in the bottom of a rowboat. The biggest surprises confirm what an unbelievable slimeball Connie is. He¡¯s about as hard to root for as any movie outlaw you can think of.And yet, partly because Mr. Pattinson¡¯s movie-star incandescence can¡¯t quite be obscured by facial hair and bad lighting, and partly because of the immutable laws of genre and spectacle, you sort of have no choice but to root for him. You¡¯re stuck with him, and you might as well make the best of it. The Safdies have explored this kind of ambiguity before. In ¡°Daddy Longlegs,¡± the wayward father, played by Ronald Bronstein (a character based on their own father), was appalling and charming in almost equal measure; his charisma both enabled and camouflaged his wanton irresponsibility. You might have recoiled in horror at his recklessness, but you couldn¡¯t deny that he loved his kids.Connie, for his part, adores his brother and has a way with dogs. While these traits don¡¯t exactly make him likable, they grant him a minimal benefit of the doubt. His manipulation of his girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) isn¡¯t nice, but on the other hand she is so whiny and needy that you can¡¯t feel too bad. Connie also has the good luck (at least as far as the audience¡¯s good graces are concerned) of falling in with the one guy in Queens who could make him look like a criminal genius ¡ª a gangly doofus named Ray (Buddy Duress), who has been spending his first days out of jail aggressively pursuing the opposite of rehabilitation. This pair is not exactly Butch and Sundance, even in their own addled, delusional minds. And while Ray is hapless and almost heroically stupid, Connie is a more complicated, less clownish figure. He has a hint of heart, as well as a cruel, predatory streak that the Safdies¡¯ expose for shocks and laughs, daring you to either take offense or take the joke, and banking on your queasiness in either case.It doesn¡¯t take much looking to notice an ugly racial dimension in Connie¡¯s behavior, though most critics overlooked it when the film was shown in Cannes this spring. When the Nikas brothers carry out the bank job, they wear hard hats, reflective vests and dark latex masks that function as crude, criminal blackface. Later, Connie takes advantage of a Caribbean immigrant (Gladys Mathon) and her granddaughter (Taliah Lennice Webster), sweet-talking and bullying them into aiding and abetting him. A black security guard (Barkhad Abdi) becomes another brutally abused pawn in Connie¡¯s senseless game.This pattern does not seem accidental. The question is what it means ¡ª what degree of self-consciousness or critical distance ¡°Good Time¡± brings to its depiction of bottom-of-the-barrel white privilege. You could infer a satirical dimension if you wanted to, or even a righteous indictment of what a lowlife can get away with if he has Mr. Pattinson¡¯s complexion. Or you could look at the film¡¯s riot of racial signifiers ¡ª the musical and pop-cultural references as well as the demographics of the setting ¡ª as a form of trolling, a coy, self-disavowing provocation.But the distinction doesn¡¯t really matter, since the movie¡¯s chief investment is not in the fates of any of its characters, nor in anything like realism, but rather in its own cool. Sometimes it flaunts its clich¨¦s ¡ª Nick¡¯s disability, and Benny Safdie¡¯s slack-jawed portrayal of it, is a big one ¡ª and other times it cloaks them in rough visual textures and jumpy, bumpy camera movements, so that a rickety genre thrill ride feels like something daring and new.

In many respects, it¡¯s not much different except it all feels a bit strained, as if everyone were trying too hard, especially its writer-director, James Gunn. Most of the ragtag futuristic fighters who powered through Vol 1. three years ago are back on board and led by Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), a cheerily roguish type who calls himself Star-Lord. The name still brings a light smile, even if the movie can¡¯t help but feel as deadly serious as any other lucratively branded Marvel property.It¡¯s tough being a hitmaker who isn¡¯t weighed down by corporate expectations, but for a while, Mr. Gunn does a pretty good job of keeping the whole thing reasonably fizzy, starting with an opener that winks at the audience with big bangs and slapstick. The movie begins in medias res, with Quill and the gang facing down a blobby adversary with fat, snapping tentacles and rows of nasty teeth ¡ª the better to eat them with or just tear them limb from limb. The Guardians take whacks at the blob, jumping and thrashing around a patently digital environment that¡¯s vaguely far-out and indeterminate. These introductions are fairly chaotic, which is the usual blockbuster way. The point is to telegraph the movie you¡¯re about to watch ¡ª the threats, fights and winks followed by more threats, fights and winks ¡ª as well as to reintroduce the crew members, their skills, traits and foibles. Alternately bulgy and sleek, hairy and shticky, they make for often-amusing company, even if this time Zoe Saldana, as Gamora, the green-skinned Amazon with grave daddy issues, feels more sidelined than before. One problem, it seems, is that Mr. Gunn is still holding off on developing the romance between her and Peter that was teased in the first movie, probably because he¡¯s saving it for the next installment. The larger problem, as it becomes progressively evident, is that this series lacks a resonant origin story, a myth, on which a world, multiple stories and a fan base can rest. The Guardians¡¯ personal stories are continuing to emerge, and the meme that¡¯s in circulation is family, which at times makes it feel as if the movie is taking cues from the ¡°Fast and Furious¡± franchise. This explains the testy, at times violent and generally dreary exchanges between Gamora and her sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), a bald badass itching to deliver payback for their rotten childhood. The performers look fierce as they slam around, squaring jaws and giving good side-eye, but it just feels like narrative filler.For the most part, Mr. Gunn puts much of his storytelling energy into filling in Quill¡¯s origins, after having already dispatched Mom in the first movie. This doesn¡¯t sound promising and isn¡¯t, alas, despite the good will that Kurt Russell brings to the part of Quill¡¯s father, Ego. At one point, Mr. Russell, or some version of him, assays the role with a weird, disrupting digital face-lift that¡¯s meant to suggest the young Ego, but really only makes you contemplate whether this Benjamin Button-style age-reversing is going to become an increasingly standard (and creepy) industry practice. It¡¯s a distraction that shows a filmmaker making a bad decision mostly, it seems, because he can afford to. Still, before Mr. Russell is swallowed up by the story and digital effects, he holds you with the laid-back vibe of a Hollywood veteran whose tan and crinkly smile tell you that sunsets and Goldie Hawn are waiting for him back in Cali. He brings an unforced looseness to the movie that it very much needs, especially after Mr. Pratt slips into a more sober register in his daddy dearest scenes. Mr. Gunn likes to play a scene straight and then jokingly pull the rug out from under it, a trick that, among other things, helps soft-sell the violence. But the father-son stuff plays flatly less because it¡¯s been told before (like, forever) than because he can¡¯t figure out how to playfully kink it up.At times, Mr. Gunn¡¯s ambitions badly backfire. Like the first movie, this one is jammed with action-driven sequences, some wildly bloated and most of them cartoonish. For one fight, though, he cranks the music and lets the screen bleed as the ostensible good guys kill one villain after another, the casualties falling to the sound of a head-bobbing song. Tonally, the episode feels unpleasantly sour and wrong for this young series, which is best when it goes light; it¡¯s a bummer watching another director attempt the kind of smiling sadism that not even Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino can always pull off. In moments like this, Mr. Gunn loses sight of the insouciance and feeling that were crucial to making the first movie work. ¡°Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2¡± certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative. Among the most appealing are the animated diorama-like tableaus that Ego uses to narrate his life, each a clue to his character. His private planet, meanwhile, is a kaleidoscopic fantasia that suggests modestly trippy science-fiction and heavy-metal cover art. This look ¡ª with its softly clashing colors and soaring stalagmites ¡ª seems designed to instigate, at least in some, flashbacks to stacks of yellowing paperbacks and lovingly played rock albums.Like some of the canned music (Fleetwood Mac, the Electric Light Orchestra), the movie¡¯s visual design gestures toward the past but mostly comes across as a generational yearning for such memories. Perhaps like some directors, Mr. Gunn fondly or regretfully looks back on a time when studio filmmakers could more or less do their own thing cinematically. Or maybe he just likes songs like ¡°Come a Little Bit Closer,¡± a Top 40 hit about a fickle dance partner that works as a nice metaphor for every movie that wants to fall into the audience¡¯s embrace, at least on opening weekend. The difference is that while the first ¡°Guardians¡± earned that love as if by accident, this one begs for it.",0.920377578223594,"Action"

The means of Tree¡¯s expirations are unoriginal and not especially scary, but the director, Christopher Landon, maintains a breezy momentum while she wakes, runs, croaks and repeats. With each resurrection, she¡¯s in slightly worse shape, but marginally better-tempered, giving Ms. Rothe room to deepen the character and arc from unsympathetic victim to loving girlfriend.Rarely out of our sight, Ms. Rothe is inexhaustible and funny, with Israel Broussard a perfect foil as her bemused, sweetly bland love interest. But it¡¯s the newcomer Rachel Matthews as Danielle, the snippy sorority president, who¡¯s the natural comedian. Encased in preppy separates and armed with withering put-downs, Danielle is every bit as deadly as any campus killer.",0.484635513937001,"Horror"

His latest picture, ¡°Happy End,¡± begins with the middle of its wide-screen frame taken up by the perfectly centered image of a phone, its camera eavesdropping on a middle-age woman whose bathroom door is open as she prepares for bed. The unseen voyeur texts snide commentary on the woman¡¯s routine.Mr. Haneke, whose technical mastery often makes his considered existential dyspepsia easier to swallow, doesn¡¯t establish an explicit motivation for the spy ¡ª the 13-year-old Eve, the second-youngest member of the singularly unhappy Laurent family, whose story this movie tells. The Laurents, a most high-bourgeois clan, are besieged by trouble. Its patriarch, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), retains some mental sharpness in his 80s, but he¡¯s losing his memory, and he¡¯d like to get out ¡ª that is, die ¡ª while he still has some faculties left. His son Thomas (Mathieu Kassovitz) has brought his daughter Eve (Fantine Harduin) to stay with him and his new wife and baby after Eve¡¯s mother attempted suicide. (Thomas also has a mistress, whom Eve learns about while cyber-eavesdropping on her father.) They are all living in the family¡¯s Calais mansion with Eve¡¯s aunt, Anne (Isabelle Huppert), who is trying to keep the family construction business afloat, a task not helped much by her wayward son, Pierre (Franz Rogowski), or a fatal accident at a building site.¡°Happy End¡± has a linear structure, but Mr. Haneke presents his scenes with little or no connective tissue. Instead of conventional transitions, there are abrupt shifts that resemble clicking through channels on a television. A scene of domestic disorder will cut to a web video in which an adolescent boy giddily chronicles his hair and skateboarding styles from videos past, and the movie lets this clip roll on quite a while before showing us that it¡¯s something Eve is watching on her computer. This strategy has a distancing effect, but also forces the viewer to stay on his or her toes.It also constitutes a bit of misdirection, in that there is a bigger picture outside of this chronicle of self-absorption. The Laurents, as what some would call wealth creators, have, in Mr. Haneke¡¯s view, some responsibility to and for a whole class of people who aren¡¯t even abstractions to them. Aside from their servants, members of the working class ¡ª both the documented and undocumented ¡ª are not often seen in this movie, but the times they are made visible are significant. They appear at key points in the movie, as when Georges, in a wheelchair after his attempted suicide-by-car fails, rolls down a street, festooned with tacky little shops, and stops in front of a group of men, most likely African immigrants. We can¡¯t hear what he¡¯s asking of them, but we can guess. The character¡¯s presumption is staggering on several levels. Like many of Mr. Haneke¡¯s films from the past two decades, ¡°Happy End¡± is set in France and features a mostly French-speaking cast. It has an uncommonly strong ensemble cast (including Toby Jones, who plays Anne¡¯s English lover and business ally), but the movie belongs to Mr. Trintignant. At the height of his career, his nuanced performing mode achieved an almost supernatural perfection, whether he was playing a romantically hapless intellectual (in ¡°My Night at Maud¡¯s,¡± released in the United States in 1970), a stoic racecar driver (in ¡°A Man and a Woman,¡± 1966) or a fascist dupe (in ¡°The Conformist,¡± 1970). Here, he is both steely and vulnerable in a role in which he has almost no physical movements to perform. In the movie¡¯s central scene, a long conversation with the troubled Eve, he merely has to move his head forward, or crook a finger, to throw a world out of its orbit.",0.703032533025112,"Drama"

Yet the atmosphere of dread that Mr. Fukada tends with such ruthless precision ¡ª and more than a little sadism ¡ª depends not on creepy camera moves or other visual trickery. Instead, this chilly tale of violent secrets and unvoiced misery relies heavily on the skill of actors who seem to know that one false move could tip the whole enterprise into comedy.Even before the arrival of the mysterious Mr. Yasaka (Tadanobu Asano), the marriage of Toshio (Kanji Furutachi), the owner of a small machine shop, and his self-effacing wife, Akie (Mariko Tsutsui), appears passionless. Polite but distant, they share meals and the care of their small daughter, Hotaru, with so little intimacy that when Toshio offers Yasaka a room and a job, he doesn¡¯t even ask his wife¡¯s opinion.

As Yasaka¡¯s presence in the household becomes ever more disruptive, the story veers in unexpected directions, leaping over years before landing with wrenching ambiguity.

And now, somewhere between the two, lies ¡°Hello Again,¡± Tom Gustafson¡¯s florid adaptation of Michael John LaChiusa¡¯s 1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzler¡¯s ¡°La Ronde¡±). What most distinguishes ¡°Hello Again¡± from the others is its cast of New York theater powerhouses, including Martha Plimpton, Audra McDonald and Cheyenne Jackson.¡°Hello Again¡± largely eschews dialogue as it leaps among historical eras and song sequences, depicting a series of fraught romantic encounters across decades. (Few film musicals have so teemed with non-graphic scenes of sexual acts.)It begins with a woman (Ms. Plimpton) who enters a peep-show-like chamber, seeking counsel about love from a mysterious masked man before her. And then it¡¯s off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on.

Though a gigantic IBM mainframe does appear in the movie ¡ª big enough to fill a room and probably less powerful than the phone in your pocket ¡ª the most important computers are three African-American women who work at NASA headquarters in Hampton, Va. Assigned to data entry jobs and denied recognition or promotion, they would go on to play crucial roles in the American space program.Based on Margot Lee Shetterly¡¯s nonfiction book of the same title, the film, directed by Theodore Melfi (who wrote the script with Allison Schroeder), turns the entwined careers of Katherine Goble (later Johnson), Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan into a rousing celebration of merit rewarded and perseverance repaid. Like many movies about the overcoming of racism, it offers belated acknowledgment of bravery and talent and an overdue reckoning with the sins of the past. And like most movies about real-world breakthroughs, ¡°Hidden Figures¡± is content to stay within established conventions. The story may be new to most viewers, but the manner in which it¡¯s told will be familiar to all but the youngest. This is not necessarily a bad thing. There is something to be said for a well-told tale with a clear moral and a satisfying emotional payoff. Mr. Melfi, whose previous film was the heart-tugging, borderline-treacly Bill Murray vehicle ¡°St. Vincent,¡± knows how to push our emotional buttons without too heavy a hand. He trusts his own skill, the intrinsic interest of the material and ¡ª above all ¡ª the talent and dedication of the cast. From one scene to the next, you may know more or less what is coming, but it is never less than delightful to watch these actors at work. Start with the three principals, whose struggles at NASA take place as the agency is scrambling to send an astronaut into orbit. Katherine Goble is the central hidden figure, a mathematical prodigy played with perfect nerd charisma by Taraji P. Henson. Katherine is plucked from the computing room and assigned to a team that will calculate the launch coordinates and trajectory for an Atlas rocket. She receives a cold welcome ¡ª particularly from an engineer named Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) ¡ª and is not spared the indignities facing a black woman in a racially segregated, gender-stratified workplace. The only bathroom she is allowed to use is in a distant building, and she horrifies her new co-workers when she helps herself to a cup of coffee.Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) and Mary (Janelle Mon¨¢e) also face discrimination. Dorothy, who is in charge of several dozen computers, is repeatedly denied promotion to supervisor and treated with condescension by her immediate boss (Kirsten Dunst). The Polish-born engineer (Olek Krupa) with whom Mary works is more enlightened, but Mary runs into the brick wall of Virginia¡¯s Jim Crow laws when she tries to take graduate-level physics courses. ¡°Hidden Figures¡± effectively conveys the poisonous normalcy of white supremacy, and the main characters¡¯ determination to pursue their ambitions in spite of it and to live normal lives in its shadow. The racism they face does not depend on the viciousness or virtue of individual white people, and for the most part the white characters are not treated as heroes for deciding, at long last, to behave decently. Two of them, however, are singled out for commendation: John Glenn, portrayed by Glen Powell as a natural democrat with no time for racial hierarchies; and Al Harrison, the head of Katherine¡¯s group, for whom the success of the mission is more important than color.Kevin Costner, who plays Al, is an actor almost uniquely capable of upstaging through understatement. He is also one of the great gum-chewers in American cinema, a habit that, along with the flattop haircut and heavy-framed glasses, gives Al an aura of midcentury no-nonsense masculine competence. He desegregates the NASA bathrooms with a sledgehammer and stands up for Katherine in quieter but no less emphatic ways when her qualifications are challenged. It¡¯s a bit much, maybe, but Mr. Costner, as usual, does what he can to give the white men of America a good name. The movie, meanwhile, expands the schoolbook chronicle of the conquest of space beyond the usual heroes, restoring some of its idealism and grandeur in the process. It also embeds that history in daily life, departing from the televised spectacle of liftoffs and landings and the public drama of the civil rights movement to spend time with its heroines and their families at home and in church. The sweetest subplot involves the romance between Katherine, a widow with three daughters, and a handsome military officer played by Mahershala Ali.¡°Hidden Figures¡± makes a fascinating and timely companion to ¡°Loving,¡± Jeff Nichols¡¯s film about the Virginia couple who challenged their state¡¯s law against interracial marriage, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1967. The two movies take place in the same state in the same era, and focus on the quiet dramas that move history forward.

They can fill you with outrage at the persistence of injustice and gratitude toward those who had the grit to stand up against it.",0.995448195797058,"Drama"

If you¡¯ve watched any of Ms. Meyers¡¯s movies, the resemblance between influence and imitation will be readily apparent. To wit: A star (Reese Witherspoon) plays a would-be charmer (here called Alice) whose neuroses are as fabulously customized as her kitchen. She¡¯s what the brand-conscious call a creative, and while she works (a bit), she spends much of her time on man troubles. Her life is as fluffed as a throw pillow and so drained of realism it is best described as a lifestyle, which can make for a killer aspirational fantasy, at least in Nancy Meyers¡¯s hands.¡°Home Again,¡± on the other hand, is wholly resistible, partly because it can¡¯t fulfill the promise of that aspirational fantasy either on a craft level or in terms of its emotional and psychological portraiture. The problems begin with the script, or perhaps just with the insulting idea that Alice would be crying buckets into a mirror because she¡¯s turning 40 on the day the story opens. Yes, she is newly separated from her music-industry husband (Michael Sheen), who likes to take calls from his New York office with its sweeping view. Alice doesn¡¯t seem too bent out of shape by the separation. She¡¯s busy building a new career as an interior decorator, and has moved with her two daughters into her childhood home, which she has redecorated to look like something out of a lower-budget Nancy Meyers movie.So why is Alice crying? Mostly to try to jump-start a movie that, formulaic step by step, needs to confirm that a single woman can be happy. You go, girl. That¡¯s more or less it, with accent pieces and yoga lessons, though there are plot complications, some involving three friends, white dudes who had a hit at a film festival and now have a power agency behind them, several freelance gigs and, of course, the promise of great shining futures as Hollywood filmmakers.

Body-function jokes are, of course, a universal comedic language, and they¡¯re here, too, although not as abundant as you might have expected.After an ostentatiously absurd and morbid origin story, in which two scrappy Mexican kids lose their dad in an explosive truck mishap, we then see one of those kids, Maximo, as a young man in his prime, seducing a considerably older grocery store heiress at a hotel pool. Twenty-five years later he and the woman are that much older, and Maximo, now played by a paunchy Mr. Derbez, is so thoroughly pampered that when he goes golfing, he putts while supine in his cart.

Spearheaded by a handful of anguished mothers whose daughters were sold into sex slavery, by way of the website Backpage.com, before they were 16, the serpentine legal proceedings have so far consumed six years and countless courtroom hours. Their greatest obstacle is a 1996 law declaring that websites can¡¯t be held responsible for third-party content.Attempting to simplify a dauntingly complex tangle of rights and responsibilities, the director, Mary Mazzio, has shaped her material into a classic heroes-and-villains showdown. Leading the white hats is the inexhaustible Erik Bauer, a strip-mall Atticus Finch wrapped in denim and moral determination; on the other side there¡¯s Homer King, described by the film as a former pimp, who shares the grooming tactics he used to control the children he calls ¡°just a product.¡± His few minutes of screen time will freeze the breath in your throat.They might also numb the critical thinking that allows you to notice the movie¡¯s lack of clear definitions for terms like sex trafficking and child sex (which mean different things in different states).

Perhaps it was a rhetorical question.A flippant ¡ª though by no means inaccurate ¡ª answer would have been 1619. But a more constructive response might have been to recommend Raoul Peck¡¯s life-altering new documentary, ¡°I Am Not Your Negro.¡± Let me do so now, for that reader (if he¡¯s still interested) and for everybody else, too. Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called ¡°race relations¡± ¡ª white supremacy and the resistance to it, in plainer English ¡ª this movie will make you think again, and may even change your mind. Though its principal figure, the novelist, playwright and essayist James Baldwin, is a man who has been dead for nearly 30 years, you would be hard-pressed to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force, insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history.To call ¡°I Am Not Your Negro¡± a movie about James Baldwin would be to understate Mr. Peck¡¯s achievement. It¡¯s more of a posthumous collaboration, an uncanny and thrilling communion between the filmmaker ¡ª whose previous work includes both a documentary and a narrative feature about the Congolese anti-colonialist leader Patrice Lumumba ¡ª and his subject. The voice-over narration (read by Samuel L. Jackson) is entirely drawn from Baldwin¡¯s work. Much of it comes from notes and letters written in the mid-1970s, when Baldwin was somewhat reluctantly sketching out a book, never to be completed, about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.Reflections on those men (all of whom Baldwin knew well) and their legacies are interspersed with passages from other books and essays, notably ¡°The Devil Finds Work,¡± Baldwin¡¯s 1976 meditation on race, Hollywood and the mythology of white innocence. His published and unpublished words ¡ª some of the most powerful and penetrating ever assembled on the tortured subject of American identity ¡ª accompany images from old talk shows and news reports, from classic movies and from our own decidedly non-post-racial present. Baldwin could not have known about Ferguson and Black Lives Matter, about the presidency of Barack Obama and the recrudescence of white nationalism in its wake, but in a sense he explained it all in advance. He understood the deep, contradictory patterns of our history, and articulated, with a passion and clarity that few others have matched, the psychological dimensions of racial conflict: the suppression of black humanity under slavery and Jim Crow and the insistence on it in African-American politics and art; the dialectic of guilt and rage, forgiveness and denial that distorts relations between black and white citizens in the North as well as the South; the lengths that white people will go to wash themselves clean of their complicity in oppression. Baldwin is a double character in Mr. Peck¡¯s film. The elegance and gravity of his formal prose, and the gravelly authority of Mr. Jackson¡¯s voice, stand in contrast to his quicksilver on-camera presence as a lecturer and television guest. In his skinny tie and narrow suit, an omnipresent cigarette between his fingers, he imports a touch of midcentury intellectual cool into our overheated, anti-intellectual media moment.A former child preacher, he remained a natural, if somewhat reluctant, performer ¡ª a master of the heavy sigh, the raised eyebrow and the rhetorical flourish. At one point, on ¡°The Dick Cavett Show,¡± Baldwin tangles with Paul Weiss, a Yale philosophy professor who scolds him for dwelling so much on racial issues. The initial spectacle of mediocrity condescending to genius is painful, but the subsequent triumph of self-taught brilliance over credentialed ignorance is thrilling to witness.In that exchange, as in a speech for an audience of British university students, you are aware of Baldwin¡¯s profound weariness. He must explain himself ¡ª and also his country ¡ª again and again, with what must have been sorely tested patience. When the students erupt in a standing ovation at the end of his remarks, Baldwin looks surprised, even flustered. You glimpse an aspect of his personality that was often evident in his writing: the vulnerable, bright, ambitious man thrust into a public role that was not always comfortable. ¡°I want to be an honest man and a good writer,¡± he wrote early in his career, in the introductory note to his first collection of essays, ¡°Notes of a Native Son.¡± The disarming, intimate candor of that statement characterized much of what would follow, as would a reckoning with the difficulties of living up to such apparently straightforward aspirations. Without sliding into confessional bathos, his voice was always personal and frank, creating in the reader a feeling of complicity, of shared knowledge and knowing humor.¡°I Am Not Your Negro¡± reproduces and redoubles this effect. It doesn¡¯t just make you aware of Baldwin, or hold him up as a figure to be admired from a distance. You feel entirely in his presence, hanging on his every word, following the implications of his ideas as they travel from his experience to yours. At the end of the movie, you are convinced that you know him. And, more important, that he knows you. To read Baldwin is to be read by him, to feel the glow of his affection, the sting of his scorn, the weight of his disappointment, the gift of his trust.Recounting his visits to the South, where he reported on the civil rights movement and the murderous white response to it, Baldwin modestly described himself as a witness, a watchful presence on the sidelines of tragedy and heroism, an outsider by virtue of his Northern origins, his sexuality and his alienation from the Christianity of his childhood. But he was also a prophet, able to see the truths revealed by the contingent, complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict. This is not to say that he transcended the struggle or detached himself from it. On the contrary, he demonstrated that writing well and thinking clearly are manifestations of commitment, and that irony, skepticism and a ruthless critical spirit are necessary tools for effective moral and political action.¡°I Am Not Your Negro¡± is a thrilling introduction to his work, a remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics ¡ª a concise, roughly 90-minute movie with the scope and impact of a 10-hour mini-series or a literary doorstop.

The shooting was tragic and traumatic for those who were there ¡ª one of Morgan¡¯s band mates stayed away from New York for many years after ¡ª but for the rest of the world, it has the qualities of a sad, strange, faded tabloid story.¡°I Called Him Morgan,¡± a suave and poignant documentary by Kasper Collin, dusts off the details of Morgan¡¯s life and death and brushes away the sensationalism, too. This is not a lurid true-crime tale of jealousy and drug addiction, but a delicate human drama about love, ambition and the glories of music. Edged with blues and graced with that elusive quality called swing, the film makes generous and judicious use of Morgan¡¯s recordings. The scarcity of film clips and audio of Morgan¡¯s voice is made up for by vivid black-and-white photographs and immortal tracks from the Blue Note catalog.There are fewer pictures of Helen Morgan, who didn¡¯t like to be photographed. But shortly before she died, in 1996, she recorded a series of interviews with Larry Reni Thomas, an adult-education instructor and radio host in Wilmington, N.C., where she was living at the time. Her voice ¡ª candid, funny and haunting ¡ª offers the counterpoint in a double biography, a chronicle of tenderness and self-destruction.The former Helen More grew up in poverty in rural North Carolina and escaped, at 17, to New York, where she established herself as, among other things, a kind of den mother to the jazz scene. Her apartment in the West 50s, not far from Birdland, was a place where musicians gathered to mingle, listen to records and eat her famous cooking. One of them was Lee Morgan, who met his future lover at a low point in his career, in the mid-1960s, when he risked squandering his early promise and crossover success in the service of his heroin habit. He had arrived in New York a decade earlier, a jug-eared, fleet-fingered teenage prodigy discovered by Dizzy Gillespie and nurtured by Art Blakey. Slender, stylish and ebullient, Morgan played the trumpet with speed, precision and an infectiousness that Mr. Collin wisely pauses to savor. He also lingers over the reminiscences of Morgan¡¯s colleagues ¡ª including Wayne Shorter, Paul West and Jymie Merritt ¡ª whose testimony provides a lesson in musical history and a primer on jazz aesthetics. Their bearing in interviews carries some of the essential qualities of the music: the wit, the dignity, the mixture of passionate feeling and critical intelligence. You could listen to these men talk all day, and then listen to them play all night.You are always aware that Morgan is missing from their company, that he should have grown into an elder statesman alongside them. Regret isn¡¯t the film¡¯s only key, though. Helen, Lee¡¯s senior by more than a decade, restored him to health and nurtured a creative rebirth. ¡°I Called Him Morgan¡± lingers in the period of their happiness, as Helen recalls it, and doesn¡¯t strain to make sense of the senseless violence that ended it.What happened that night seems as simple and as mysterious as a murder ballad, and yet at the same time, more a terrible accident than a full-blown tragedy. It¡¯s startling to realize how young Morgan was ¡ª 32 or 33, depending on which news article you believe ¡ª given how much he had lived. But that¡¯s what art does, including documentary film: It expands the scope of life and distills its beauty and its pain.",0.99849131009469,"Documentary"

But the giving is itself an act of such passive-aggressive loathing that it all but destroys any comedic potential in their relationship, never mind any desire we might have to see their union endure.In that we¡¯re joined by Vivian (Dolly Wells), a bitter British filmmaker who believes marriage to be unsustainable.

As a child, she is degraded and smacked around by her mother, who kicks little Tonya¡¯s chair so violently the kid flies off it. When the teenage Tonya gets involved with the man she will marry, her life as a punching bag continues. Her husband smashes her head onto a glass surface so hard that shards scatter; he bloodies her nose a few times. He also points a gun at Tonya, threatening to kill her. Despite all the beatings and blood, ¡°I, Tonya¡± insists it¡¯s a comedy.The real Tonya Harding went from fame to infamy in 1994, after she was implicated in an attack on Nancy Kerrigan, a rival. On Jan. 6, after practicing for the United States Figure Skating Championships in Detroit, Ms. Kerrigan was attacked by a man who thwacked her leg with a collapsible police baton. (He seems to have been going for her knee.) A camera captured Ms. Kerrigan on the ground as she repeatedly wailed ¡°Why?¡± Ms. Harding went on to win the championship; it was a short-lived victory. The F.B.I. was soon questioning her, her ex-husband and their dumb-and-dumber associates. By June, Ms. Harding had been barred from competing for her role in the attack. Energetically directed by Craig Gillespie, ¡°I, Tonya¡± charts the hard-won rise and calamitous fall of its title character (Margot Robbie). Taking the form of a mock, mocking documentary, one that disjointedly swings between heehaw comedy and wincing agony, the movie establishes its raised-eyebrow tone with a title card stating it¡¯s ¡°Based on irony-free, wildly contradictory and totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly,¡± her former husband. (The screenwriter, Steven Rogers, has said that he spoke with both.) From their separate corners, the middle-aged, long-divorced Tonya and Jeff (Sebastian Stan), provide linked, at times vividly contradictory accounts of what happened. In one location, Jeff sits facing the camera in front of a large window framed by photo-covered walls. There¡¯s a lot more visual coding going on with Tonya, who¡¯s plunked down at a table in a modest kitchen wearing a pale jeans jacket and cowboy boots. Lank blond hair and bangs border her face; her neck has gone puffy. Looking into the camera, she occasionally draws on a cigarette and crosses her legs, one big, down-home, country-gal ankle resting on a knee. The real eye-catchers are the dirty dishes stacked in the sink behind her. They stay put and stay dirty, which seems curiously sloppy given that Tonya, a media veteran, is here to tell her truth. If you didn¡¯t know she had a reputation as down-and-dirty, here¡¯s a hint.As Tonya and Jeff offer up alternating stories, her past, her abuse and her triumphs come into view. The only daughter of an unhappily married couple, the young Tonya is a daddy¡¯s girl. Her father takes her hunting, teaching her how to shoot rabbit. Her awful mother, LaVona (Allison Janney, chilled and excellent), is the one who arranges for Tonya to take lessons with a skating coach (Julianne Nicholson). Tonya turns out to be a prodigy and is soon powering her way into the top echelon of the sport, despite the snobbery and visible discomfort of the judges who favor froufrou femininity over aggressive competition. They want gliding princesses, not grunting athletes like Tonya.The story of Tonya Harding has been told before in mainstream journalism and in scholarly accounts, documentaries and a quickie made-for-TV movie that lathered the soap. Before and after the incident, as it¡¯s often called, she was grist for thumb-sucking takes on women, femininity, sports and social class. Before the attack, writers liked to point out that Ms. Harding played pool and drove a truck. In a sympathetic 1992 profile, Sports Illustrated described her as a ¡°hardscrabble, dispossessed kid¡± who had become ¡°an interloper in the realm of pixies and queens who¡¯s as at home doing a brake job as she is performing an arabesque.¡± She was Cinderella with edge and muscles. In ¡°I, Tonya,¡± she is also an unreliable narrator, just like Jeff. ¡°There¡¯s no such thing as truth,¡± Tonya announces. ¡°Everyone has their own truth.¡± The film takes up this statement as its guiding narrative principle, toggling between the she-said and he-said as it hurdles toward its nadir. The older Tonya makes an assertion, and the older Jeff does likewise. The young Tonya ¡ª in flashback ¡ª says one thing, the young Jeff says something else, and every so often LaVona chimes in. Characters periodically break the fourth wall by looking into the camera and directly addressing the viewer, as if to assert ownership on the unwinding story. Listen to me, each seems to say in these moments. Ms. Robbie takes on the role with vigor and strained toothy smiles, giving an outsize performance that suits the film¡¯s broadness and showy surfaces. (She does much of her own skating, though the trickier moves were completed with stunt doubles and digital effects.) Despite the makeup and a few tragic haircuts, Ms. Robbie remains an unpersuasive fit for the tiny Ms. Harding, who could bench press more than her weight and whose sculptured muscles freaked some out. You could write a treatise on female bodies pegged to the contempt that journalists unloaded on her, especially after the attack, when they called her ¡°white trash¡± and ¡°old Thunder Thighs.¡± She was 23.As ¡°I, Tonya¡± skips here and there and thickens the plot, it becomes increasingly baffling why the filmmakers decided to put a comic spin on this pathetic, dispiriting story. No matter how hard the movie tries to coax out laughs, there¡¯s little about Ms. Harding, her circumstances or her choices that skews as funny. She was poor, grew up in trailers, had a temper, liked loud colors, dropped out of school, traded in one abuser for another and maintained some stupid acquaintances ¡ª a clown posse the filmmakers lavish too much time on. She might have played a role in the attack on Ms. Kerrigan, but in many ways Ms. Harding had already been found guilty for just being who she was. The same feels true here.¡°I, Tonya¡± asserts that the truth is elusive. Yet some facts are known. Ms. Harding ¡ª as was widely reported ¡ª took out restraining orders against Mr. Gillooly, telling the police that he had hit her and she was afraid of him. Back then, her abuse was often played down; here, it is countered by scenes in which the tough Tonya fights back, at times with a comedic spin, as if to suggest that she can give as good as she gets. That makes this film and the brutality more breezily watchable, I suppose. Still, it¡¯s instructive that at one point Tonya lectures the audience on its complicity in how she was treated. It¡¯s an impressively disingenuous wag of the finger from a film that has encouraged our laughter right from the start.",0.358217428280218,"Biography"

The first two follow a pattern that will be familiar to ¡°Law & Order¡± fans. A crime is investigated, and then a trial conducted, with a few twists and reversals on the way to the verdict. The emphasis, though, falls less on the procedural aspects of the case than its psychological effects, specifically on Katja Sekerci (Diane Kruger), a German woman whose husband and young son are killed in a bombing in Hamburg.Mr. Akin, whose previous features include the explosive ¡°Head-On¡± and the sprawling, wrenching political melodrama ¡°The Edge of Heaven,¡± observes his characters and their social environment with a rigorously measured mix of intensity and detachment. Katja, in the days and weeks after the attack, spirals through stages of grief, shock and despair. Surrounded by relatives, friends and in-laws, and visited by pushy, polite detectives, she seems desperately, furiously alone. Because her husband, Nuri (Numan Akar), was a Turkish immigrant and a former drug dealer, the police raise the specters of Islamist terrorism and gang activity. Katja is adamant: ¡°Nazis killed my husband.¡± She has the grim satisfaction of being right. If the first section of ¡°In the Fade¡± provides a series of snapshots of a contemporary German life ¡ª the hectic pleasures of its big cities; its ambivalent multiculturalism; its bureaucratic humanism ¡ª the second part zeros in on the gears of the country¡¯s legal system. Subtlety gives way to blunter characterizations when the two main advocates spar in the courtroom. Katja¡¯s interests are represented by an old friend (Denis Moschitto), who seems kind and conscientious. The accused murderers, a young married couple, are defended by a tall, bald, sarcastic lawyer (Johannes Krisch) who is perhaps a bit too transparently villainous. But he does succeed in galvanizing the audience¡¯s disgust, and in reframing the story as a conflict between the desire for justice and the drive for vengeance. This is a venerable theme in movies, driving the plots of most of westerns. In this instance, it carries an extra jolt of political relevance. How should liberal societies deal with homegrown political extremists, who seek protection from the democratic norms and institutions they are committed to destroying? How should the victims of far-right-wing violence fight back?That last question brings about a startling change of scene and tone in the movie¡¯s final section, which feels like a miniature film noir set in the incongruous sunshine of Greece. But just as ¡°In the Fade¡± should be reaching its starkest, sharpest point, as Katja¡¯s pain pushes her toward a moral crisis, Mr. Akin¡¯s focus seems to waver, and the sense of tough existential clarity that is his greatest virtue goes blurry. The ending is puzzling, when it wants to be devastating, and the political and personal sides of the story, rather than illuminating each other, fight to a stalemate.Ms. Kruger, however, who won the best actress award at Cannes in May, leaves a vivid, haunting impression. Katja, who has already traveled a path from wildness to domestic stability, struggles with the enforced passivity of violent bereavement. With her husband and son gone, the world is dislodged from its axis, and there is nothing Katja can do to set it right again.

Others, like the woman returning to Montana to reconcile with her family, or the expectant mother eager to reach Minnesota before she goes into labor ¡ª a prospect that alarms several conductors ¡ª are on board for only part of the way. Yet ¡°In Transit¡± illustrates how their journeys mirror one another, and not just geographically. A 21-year-old heads to North Dakota, convinced that seven years of oil-boom work will earn him money for life. Another man, having already toiled there, heads in the opposite direction, to Indiana and the woman he loves, to settle down, something he thought he¡¯d never do. He worries about finding a job there.Other passengers seek to forget romance or to clear their heads. The mix is roughly even between those settling unfinished business and those, like the young man from Mississippi who left his job overnight, who have hopped aboard on impulse.¡°In Transit¡± has been edited ¡ª by Ms. True ¡ª to privilege narrative over chronology. At any moment, the movie is liable to turn up at a different spot along the route, a sort of productive disorientation that contributes to a feeling of universality. Anyone who thinks the movie was easy to make should try getting watchable footage out of a train window. (A separate drive-along trip was necessary for the picturesque exterior shots.)While observing roughhousing children, dining car meals, card games and a jam session, the movie makes room for perceptive observations on class, race and upbringing. At times, ¡°In Transit¡± seems utopian in its optimism that all it takes to get two people talking is to put them in adjacent seats.

Pennywise the clown, the designated predator in ¡°It,¡± (played by Bill Skarsgard) is, like Freddy Krueger, an avatar of deep childhood fears. And like Freddy, he¡¯s also the literal, lethal manifestation of the evil of the world. As such, he has the potential to spawn endless sequels. He¡¯ll be back.Or rather, he is back. Mr. Muschietti¡¯s ¡°It,¡± written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, represents a second trip to this particular well. Mr. King¡¯s novel, published in 1986, was adapted for network television in 1990. The new movie, a skillful blend of nostalgic sentiment and hair-raising effects, with the visual punch of big-screen digital hocus-pocus and the liberties of the R rating, still has the soothing charm of familiarity. The gang of misfit ¡¯80s kids who face down the clown and the deeper horror he represents evoke both the middle school posse of the recent TV series ¡°Stranger Things¡± (there¡¯s some overlap in the cast), but also the intrepid brotherhood from ¡°Stand by Me,¡± surely one of the all-time top five Stephen King movie adaptations.We can argue about the others ¡ª I¡¯m happy to make a case for John Carpenter¡¯s underrated ¡°Christine¡± ¡ª but this ¡°It¡± doesn¡¯t quite ascend to their level. Nonetheless, the filmmakers honor both the pastoral and the infernal dimensions of Mr. King¡¯s distinctive literary vision. Derry, with its redbrick storefronts and its quirks and kinks, seems like a genuinely nice place to live in spite of the fact that its citizens, children in particular, turn up missing or maimed at an alarming rate. The supernatural nastiness embodied by Pennywise is abetted and to some extent camouflaged by the ordinary human awfulness that also afflicts Derry. In addition to menacing clowns, phantasmatic lepers and spooky paintings come to life, the town is home to an ugly assortment of bullies (the worst one played by Nicholas Hamilton), gossips and abusive parents. Against these forces ¡ª the banal and the diabolical alike ¡ª ¡°It¡± assembles a squad of early and preadolescent ghostbusters as varied as an infantry platoon in a World War II combat picture. The leader is Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), a melancholy, thoughtful boy whose little brother, Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott), has been spirited down a storm sewer by Pennywise. Bill¡¯s comrades ¡ª they call themselves the Losers¡¯ Club ¡ª include a nerdy chatterbox (Finn Wolfhard) and a germ-phobic mama¡¯s boy (Jack Dylan Grazer), plus a Jewish kid (Wyatt Oleff), a black kid (Chosen Jacobs) and a new kid (Jeremy Ray Taylor). Also a girl, Bev (Sophia Lillis), who becomes part of a sweet, alliterative romantic triangle involving Bill and the new kid, whose name is Ben.Like many real kids ¡ª even in 1989, even in Maine ¡ª they have filthy mouths. They also experience the freedom and peril of growing up in the days before cellphones, bicycle helmets and helicopter parenting. What¡¯s scary about ¡°It,¡± for them and for the audience, is also fun. The group ranges freely through the forests and fields around Derry, playing detective until the forces of darkness stand revealed with slimy tentacles and multiple rows of sharp, ravenous teeth.That isn¡¯t a spoiler, but it¡¯s a bit of paradox. The non-clown essence of It, an H.R. Gigeresque vagina dentata type of deal, is far less scary than Pennywise, with his fluting voice and red balloons, and the other specters that seem to spring from tender young psyches. As creature design has become easier and more elaborate, thanks to digital techniques, it has also become less imaginative. Movie monsters resemble one another more and more, and movies of distinct genres feel increasingly trapped within the expected. The climactic sequence of ¡°It¡± sacrifices horror-movie creepiness for action-movie bombast, staging a big fight in a cavernous space. We might as well be looking at superheroes.That we aren¡¯t comes as a relief. The young cast is consistently good company, in particular the Ben-Bill-Bev trio. Ms. Lillis earns the Molly Ringwald reference that mischievously pops up in the script as a wink to those in the audience who still remember the ¡¯80s.

Pure coincidence, of course. And while the genre waxes and wanes like the moon over a creepy old house, it is unlikely to disappear as long as we have fears that need purging. It¡¯s the nature of those fears that tends to shift over time ¡ª from the social to the psychological, from supernatural evil to human depravity, from what¡¯s out there to what¡¯s in here.¡°It Comes at Night,¡± a rigorous and astute film written and directed by Trey Edward Shults, plays the outside-in dialectic beautifully. Initially, the premise looks like one we¡¯ve seen plenty of times before: An epidemic has wiped out a lot of the population; food and water are scarce; survivors barricade themselves against contamination from the sick and competition from the healthy.All of that is established quickly and obliquely. No zombies come shambling through the woods, and Mr. Shults doesn¡¯t jolt the audience with false scares or showy plot twists. He builds up the dread with ruthless efficiency and minimal gimmickry, relying on and refreshing some of the oldest techniques in the book. The camera glides down a long, dimly lighted corridor. The soundtrack pulses with dissonant chords and heartbeat rhythms. (The score is by Brian McOmber.) Daylight is scarce, and shadows are long. Paul (Joel Edgerton) and Sarah (Carmen Ejogo), with their 17-year-old son, Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), and a dog named Stanley have turned a rambling country house into a fortress and a sanctuary. Grieving after the death of Sarah¡¯s father (David Pendleton), they cling to a routine that they hope will keep them safe. Before long they are joined by another family, a younger, less somber mirror image of themselves: Will (Christopher Abbott), Kim (Riley Keough) and their little son, Andrew (Griffin Robert Faulkner). Needless to say, the visitors bring complications as well as companionship. There is sexual tension between Travis and Kim, and masculine rivalry between Paul and Will. Mistrust simmers and occasionally breaks into the open. The forest, meanwhile, is full of strange sounds and movements. And the house is full of guns.What happens is both shocking and, in retrospect, brutally inevitable. ¡°It Comes at Night¡± is pretty terrifying to sit through, but it may be even scarier after it¡¯s over, when you sift through what you¡¯ve seen and try to piece together what it may have meant. Travis, who is plagued by nightmares, tries to do just that, and serves as the viewer¡¯s surrogate. His perspective seems to be the only one we can trust, and he seems relatively sensitive, decent and innocent.Not that anyone else is all that terrible. The two sets of parents are surely doing their best. But when Paul asks, ¡°Do you know what people are capable of when they¡¯re desperate?¡± it isn¡¯t exactly a rhetorical question. Rather, it¡¯s the problem Mr. Shults has set out to investigate, with a precision that is all the more unnerving for being fundamentally humane.Mr. Shults¡¯s first feature, the remarkable ¡°Krisha,¡±  was a family drama that often felt like a horror movie. ¡°It Comes at Night¡± is the reverse. There are obvious differences of style and tone ¡ª ¡°Krisha¡± was talky and busy; the new film is taciturn and austere ¡ª but the director¡¯s preoccupations are as consistent as his sensibility. In both cases, people are thrown together in a house by circumstances they don¡¯t control, and how they will deal with it all becomes an ethical text with stakes high enough to implicate the audience as well as the characters. ¡°It Comes at Night¡± is very much worth seeing on its own. It¡¯s smart without making too big a deal of its own cleverness, and admirably thrifty. If you haven¡¯t seen ¡°Krisha,¡± though, I¡¯d recommend a double bill, an early-career retrospective of the work of a spookily self-assured, slyly ambitious young filmmaker whose apparently modest stories have mighty implications.Both films are about the impulse to preserve a sense of normalcy in difficult circumstances, and both reveal the cruelty behind that impulse. Paul and Sarah are not only struggling to save their family but also to hold onto a civilization ¡ª a sense of order, of dignity, of stability ¡ª that is in the midst of collapsing.

The giggles start with the playful title: ¡°Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond ¡ª Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton.¡± It¡¯s an amusing pileup that in its excess hints at the rich weirdness that emerged when Mr. Carrey nearly went off the rails playing Kaufman in the biopic ¡°Man on the Moon.¡± One of those tidy, fumbled stories of genius, it will be forever supplanted by this movie¡¯s dizzily, fantastically entertaining account of its two strange, twinned and messy geniuses.Kaufman, who died from lung cancer in 1984, was a standup who hit the mainstream playing Latka Gravas, a mechanic of indeterminate national origin, in the sitcom ¡°Taxi.¡± That show was a critical favorite, if not a ratings behemoth, and it goosed the big-screen careers of some of its players (Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd). Kaufman wasn¡¯t made for movies, but in live shows as well as on ¡°Saturday Night Live¡± and on talk shows (David Letterman), he continued to test the limits of his singular absurdist comedy by assuming the guise of innocent fools or spectacularly awful louts. Kaufman is still sometimes referred to as a cult comic, a category that skews reductive decades later.¡°Jim & Andy¡± revisits Kaufman¡¯s tragically abridged story, largely through Mr. Carrey¡¯s experiences playing him. By the time Mr. Carrey signed on to make ¡°Man on the Moon¡± (1999), he was a major movie star, having appeared in both commercial hits (¡°Dumb and Dumber¡±) and critical successes (¡°The Truman Show¡±). Physically, he may have seemed a bit off to play Kaufman (too lanky, too crowned with hair), but he took on the role with painstaking if seemingly typical actorly mimicry. Mr. Carrey found the character in big and little ways: in Kaufman¡¯s many voices, his fixed stare and in the walks, stances and gestures he used to play characters or when he was just being (or playing) Andy. ¡°Jim & Andy¡± suggests that in finding Kaufman, Mr. Carrey also lost himself, at least for a while (though maybe longer). The story of what happened during the making of ¡°Man on the Moon¡± has been covered before, including in news articles published around the time of its release. In one, a journalist who visited the set during production noted that Mr. Carrey never broke character even after cut was called. In another account, Mr. DeVito, who played George Shapiro, Andy Kaufman¡¯s manager in ¡°Man on the Moon,¡± said Mr. Carrey dove so deeply into his role as Kaufman that ¡°Jim only came to work two days during the filming.¡± That sure sounds like the final word on the Carrey-Kaufman cinematic convergence. Directed by Chris Smith, ¡°Jim & Andy¡± reveals that those earlier reports ¡ª which read as if yet another performer had taken the whole Method acting thing a touch too far ¡ª hardly get at the strangeness that materialized (and lingers). ¡°So, Jim, how would you start this movie?,¡± an offscreen Mr. Smith asks Mr. Carrey at the start. Seated in what looks like an anonymous hotel room and wearing a luxurious beard and a leather jacket, Mr. Carrey grunts softly and glances away. And then, looking directly into the camera, he says: ¡°Well, if I had my choice, it wouldn¡¯t start at all. It would already have been.¡± Mr. Carrey breaks into a small, ambiguous smile. ¡°And it wouldn¡¯t end, either.¡±Is Mr. Carrey smiling at his words or his memories (or at us)? It can be hard to know, an uncertainty that fits the movie¡¯s exploration of reality and its simulations. By contrast, the documentary¡¯s genesis, which is partly spelled out in title cards, is rather clearer and can be traced to some 100 hours of behind-the-scenes video shot during the making of ¡°Man on the Moon.¡± This material had been stashed in Mr. Carrey¡¯s offices for almost 20 years until the director Spike Jonze (¡°Her¡±), a producer on ¡°Jim & Andy,¡± persuaded Mr. Carrey to do something with it. Mr. Smith, whose earlier titles include ¡°American Movie¡± and ¡°The Yes Men,¡± was hired and smartly set his focus on Mr. Carrey.The result isn¡¯t another ho-hum documentary likeness in which all the elements neatly and often flatteringly stack up. ¡°Jim & Andy¡± is instead a complexly layered and textured Cubist portrait, one that¡¯s been constructed from fragments of its two title subjects and their work. In one corner of the portrait there¡¯s something from Mr. Carrey¡¯s life (a story about his father, a glimpse of an early routine); in another, something from Kaufman¡¯s personal history (his family, his work, his illness). Sometimes these fragments rest side by side, at other times they overlap. And, every so often, Kaufman¡¯s notorious alter ego Tony Clifton, an obnoxious lounge lizard, muscles in to upend the entire thing.¡°Jim & Andy¡± folds a lot into its 95 minutes. It slides from art to life ¡ª thoughtfully poking around in that blurred space between them ¡ª and jumps around in time, all while flipping from Kaufman to Mr. Carrey and then to Mr. Carrey as Mr. Kaufman. (The editor is Barry Poltermann.) You never get lost amid all these multiple identities and realities, which Mr. Smith amusingly, at times alarmingly, gathers together. It¡¯s funny watching Milos Forman ¡ª who directed ¡°Man on the Moon¡± ¡ª refer to Mr. Carrey as Andy, but when Mr. Carrey turns into Tony Clifton something more sinister and menacing comes through. Is this art, indulgence or madness? As this documentary reminds you, with hard laughter and startlingly intense emotion, comedy always needs its pound of flesh.",0.0612685143471355,"Documentary"

The persona she creates on the page is always frank but never ingratiating.So it¡¯s disarming to see a relatively cozy Joan Didion in the documentary ¡°Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold,¡± but it should not be surprising. The movie is directed by Griffin Dunne, one of Ms. Didion¡¯s nephews, who also appears as an onscreen interviewer. The Dunne-Didions are a storied family whose members are, and have been, significant cultural forces. They are also a clan rived by tragedy. Two of Ms. Didion¡¯s most celebrated recent works concern the deaths of her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, and her daughter, Quintana Roo. The exchanges between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion are at once fond and candid. When Mr. Dunne suggests that his uncle, Ms. Didion¡¯s husband, was a ¡°protector,¡± Ms. Didion nods animatedly before adding, ¡°And a hothead.¡± The relationship between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion limits the movie in certain ways, but opens it up in others. Mr. Dunne¡¯s longtime family connections and his own prestige as a filmmaker no doubt helped him snag interviews that other documentarians would be hard-pressed to schedule. Ms. Didion¡¯s friend Calvin Trillin is among the interviewees, and while I¡¯d never dare suggest that great writer is not a big get, I was impressed in a different way when Harrison Ford showed up.While the movie covers the whole of Ms. Didion¡¯s life (and even the period before it, offering a fun fact that at one point the pioneer Didions traveled with the Donner party), those expecting a thorough examination of Ms. Didion¡¯s work may be disappointed. Which is not to say that Mr. Dunne, a very canny filmmaker, doesn¡¯t accomplish a lot via implication. The movie is subtly bracketed by readings of Ms. Didion¡¯s appreciation of John Wayne, in an early essay, and her excoriation of Vice President Dick Cheney, in a later one. Unlike a great many more facile thinkers, Ms. Didion clearly does not consider them equivalent figures. But the citation of both works illuminates the changes in Ms. Didion¡¯s thinking over the years.Her early writing reveals the instincts of a conservative. As she witnessed the tectonic shifts in American life wrought by, among other things, the counterculture, she admittedly lost faith in ¡°the social contract,¡± but did not turn left for solutions; rather, she staked a claim as a kind of ideological outsider.

The game winds up in the room of a teenager who ignores it, because who wants to play a board game? Overnight, the board game magically turns into a video game cartridge. And upon being inserted into the teen¡¯s console, something strange happens.The movie cuts to the present day and introduces four archetypal, irritating teen characters. There¡¯s the smart and awkward Spencer; his former best friend ¡°Fridge,¡± now a high school football star who makes Spencer do his homework; the selfie-obsessed popular girl, Bethany; and Martha, who¡¯s a diluted variation of Allison, the smartest and angriest girl in the room in ¡°The Breakfast Club.¡± And much like in that movie, these kids all get detention together.At first, I presumed that the film¡¯s increased attention on these teenagers was to make us that much more eager for the stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black to show up.

The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie, ¡°Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,¡± was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay, etc.), but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup. The story is a confusion of noise, visual clutter and murderous digital gnats, but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through.The last time he fronted a movie, Superman (Henry Cavill) seemed to die, a plot twist that not even the most credulous viewer could buy. So, of course he¡¯s back in this one, eventually, although first the band needs to get together. Having seen trouble on the horizon, Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne ¡ª played with a sepulchral growl and bespoke stubble by Ben Affleck ¡ª takes the lead on this enterprise. He¡¯s the insistent manager as well as the scowling host, the guy with the cool digs, smooth rides with blinking screens (¡°critical damage¡± reads one with great comic-book sincerity) and suave butler (Jeremy Irons as Alfred). He¡¯s also pretty much of a yawn.The pumped-up Mr. Affleck again fills out the bat suit from ripped stem to stern, but his costume remains grievously larger than Batman¡¯s (or Bruce¡¯s) personality. Bat-Bruce clearly has some kind of unrequited thing for Wonder Woman, a.k.a. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot, a charming super-presence), which leads him to stammer like a teenager. (She¡¯s got other things on her mind.) He has money and a modest sense of humor, including about his wealth, which inspires one of the movie¡¯s few decent laughs. Mr. Affleck, a generally appealing actor who can plumb the depths when pushed (¡°Gone Girl¡±), needs something more substantial (or just more jokes) if his Batman is ever going to work. As it is, the little bit of bat brooding in ¡°Justice League¡± feels unmotivated and unearned, and lacks the shading of the character in the ¡°Dark Knight¡± or even in the Lego movies. That¡¯s too bad, and would be dire if he played a more valuable role. But ¡°Justice League¡± is about solidarity rather than flying and soaring solo, so the movie spends considerable time piecing together its newest parts: the Flash, a.k.a. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller), a zippy wisenheimer wreathed in lightning; Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), an underwater tough with a chest full of muscles and tattoos; and Cyborg, a.k.a. Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), a machine man built from metal and serious attitude. The original Justice League of America (as it was called) first convened in 1960; the movie takes place in the present or at least a facsimile of the same. The world is in mourning for Superman, and so is Lois Lane (Amy Adams, shedding tears and largely wasted). Everything is about to get worse, because of course it has to, leading Bat-Bruce and Wonder-Diana to round up a troika that was teased earlier. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the introductions to these three newcomers, who step up beauty pageant-style to fill in some back story ¡ª one has roots in Atlantis, the other two are from hard-luck city ¡ª while flexing individual quirks and superpowers.¡°Justice League¡± settles into a groove once it finds its gang. As Bat-Bruce moodily pushes and prods and Wonder-Diana smiles and smirks, the newbies jockey for position. The Flash gets most of the best jokes, and Mr. Miller makes most of them work, largely in the role of in-house fanboy with a touch of the Cowardly Lion. It¡¯s golly-gee stuff, but it¡¯s also human and Mr. Miller keeps you hooked, as does Mr. Momoa (¡°Game of Thrones¡±), who supplely shifts between gravitas and comedy. When Aquaman chugs a bottle of booze before plunging into an angry sea, the movie hits the comic-book sweet spot between deadly seriousness and self-amused levity.Cyborg isn¡¯t as buoyant a presence, which makes sense for a character who¡¯s been partly cobbled together from scraps and a sob story that Mr. Fisher puts across with bowed head and palpable heaviness. The hoodie he sometimes wears, which can¡¯t help but evoke Trayvon Martin, imparts a larger meaning that the movie doesn¡¯t or can¡¯t explore. Like the references to a coming world catastrophe that suggestively shudders with wider implications, the hoodie suggests filmmakers who are still struggling to keep an eye on the offscreen world while spinning a fictional universe that can somehow offer a brief escape from it.Mr. Snyder remains regrettably committed to a dark, desaturated palette that borders on the murky, and this movie¡¯s chaotic, unimaginative action scenes can drag on forever. But the touches of humor in ¡°Justice League¡± lighten the whole thing tonally and are a relief after the dirgelike ¡°Batman v Superman,¡± which he ran into the ground with a two-and-a-half-hour running time. (¡°Justice League¡± clocks in at a not-exactly fleet two hours.) Written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon, the new movie shows a series that¡¯s still finding its footing as well as characters who, though perhaps not yet as ostensibly multidimensional as Marvel¡¯s, may be more enduring (and golden).

The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (as the Communists were officially known) conceived Karl-Marx-Stadt as a showcase of productivity and prosperity, an industrial powerhouse devoted to the supremacy of the East German proletariat.After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Ms. Epperlein made her way to the West. She and Mr. Tucker, an American-born filmmaker, together made a series of tough-minded, intellectually curious shorts and features, including ¡°Gunner Palace¡± (2005), one of the first documentaries about the Iraq War and still one of the best. In ¡°Karl Marx City,¡± she steps in front of the camera and returns to her hometown, excavating the zone where family and national history intersect. Accompanied by a third-person voice-over narration ¡ª she is not ¡°I¡± but ¡°she¡± in her own story ¡ª Ms. Epperlein interviews her mother and brothers, historians and archivists, members of the Stasi and their victims. That isn¡¯t always an obvious distinction. The Stasi security service deployed hundreds of thousands of East German citizens as spies and informants, creating a climate of near-total surveillance and pervasive paranoia. Stasi agents routinely collected information from colleagues and neighbors, and broke into apartments in search of incriminating evidence. What they usually found, according to one former officer, were hand-copied West German television schedules and overnight bags packed in anticipation of flight or arrest.Ms. Epperlein conducts her inquiry armed with a giant, fuzz-covered microphone and adorned with a pair of heavy black headphones. This equipment looks a bit comical, but its presence is as much a declaration of ethical principles as an arresting visual joke. The Stasi took pictures and made recordings in secret; its surveillance was stealthy, invisible. Ms. Epperlein ¡ª who with her cropped blond hair and regal bearing resembles Robin Wright in ¡°House of Cards¡± ¡ª becomes a walking emblem of honesty and transparency, an embodiment of the documentary ideal.In addition to illuminating the inner workings of everyday political terror, she tries to shed light on a family tragedy. In 1999, 10 years after the collapse of East German communism, Ms. Epperlein¡¯s father committed suicide. Fifteen years after that, his only daughter forces herself to confront the awful possibility that he might have collaborated with the Stasi. So many people did.The mystery of her father¡¯s life and death provides ¡°Karl Marx City¡± with suspense, and with a concrete sense of profound moral and emotional stakes.

It¡¯s possible that many, maybe most, of that earlier generation is no longer with us.People who live outside of the places where the AIDS crisis hit hardest tend to mistakenly believe that it¡¯s under control. ¡°Kiki,¡± a spiritual descendant of Ms. Livingston¡¯s film, implicitly insists the devastation that H.I.V. and AIDS wrought persists. As a partial result, the queer and transgender teenagers of the post-ballroom culture, which they call the ¡°Kiki scene,¡± have, it seems, only themselves to rely on. Even those who have at least one supportive parent, as Mr. Pucci Gar<U+00E7>on does, carry a kind of visual loneliness despite their ability to strike a pose.And the poses are fierce, though here they are struck in various makeshift spaces ¡ª high school gymnasiums, it appears at times, rather than ballrooms. The kids frequently trek from Harlem to the Christopher Street pier, where they marvel at what they perceive to be the blatant homophobia of the police officers in this relatively gay-friendly neighborhood. The semiotics of the scene are as complex as those of the last generation who hosted the dance balls. As one (unofficial) ball competition coach advises about another performer¡¯s stance, ¡°No one can tell you what you¡¯re not, because you¡¯re real,¡± with the last word in a set of inflected quotation marks. Ms. Jordeno chronicled her tight-knit group for several years, and was able to document two of her subjects, Gia Marie Love and Izana Vidal, at various stages of their transitioning to women. These are tough but tenderhearted young people who speak frankly about their various challenges, including the lure of sex work ¡ª relatively easy money in a world that still doesn¡¯t much like seeing trans people working ¡°straight¡± jobs.One subject, speaking of trying in his early teens to come to grips with discovering that he was gay, says: ¡°I thought, no, that can¡¯t be possible. It¡¯s not true.¡± American society is full of people who shrug off the struggles of such individuals as ¡°lifestyle choices,¡± and the current sociopolitical climate is inarguably actively encouraging a backlash in transgender tolerance. ¡°Kiki¡± shows us a group of brave and beautiful souls for whom the struggle is, unfortunately, probably about to get even harder.",0.963789854450303,"Documentary"

The documentary, which features a lengthy prison interview with him, is hardly the first reconsideration of the case.

And, well, why should it be or how could it be, given who¡¯s behind the camera? The director Guy Ritchie likes his action fast and frenetic, and he¡¯s more focused on how things look ¡ª mostly, he¡¯s chasing that certain something called cool ¡ª than in narrative coherency or plausibility. And, anyway, those angry elephants are magical, just like the dragons swooping through the HBO show ¡°Game of Thrones.¡± It¡¯s hard not to attribute the existence of this new Arthurian tale in part to the global success of ¡°Game of Thrones,¡± which has hooked legions on its epic soap opera, clashing swords, spurting blood and unending intrigue. (That show¡¯s Aidan Gillen pops up here too.) The Arthur story has played out differently across the centuries, from the Middle Ages to T. H. White¡¯s novel ¡°The Sword in the Stone¡± to Disney¡¯s 20th-century cartoon take, and each moment in time shapes the way it¡¯s told. In this case, that means something old, something blockbustery and that Guy Ritchie je ne sais quoi. Put differently, this variation on the Arthurian legend fleetingly brings to mind ¡°Game of Thrones¡± but mostly plays out according to the Ritchie template: a self-amused, endlessly resourceful laddish hero gets in and out of trouble with winks, smarts and brute force, sometimes in the company of Jude Law. This time the resident rogue is Arthur, played with easy, low-wattage charisma by Charlie Hunnam, who has a gift for delivering nonsense without seeming embarrassed. Mr. Law, who played Watson in Mr. Ritchie¡¯s ¡°Sherlock¡± flicks, takes on mustache-twirling duties as Vortigern, a louche pouter who skulks around in black, doubtless dreaming of Richard III. Arthur and Vortigern mix it up amid a lot of shenanigans, detours and filler, some bad, some good and all of it disposable. Written by Mr. Ritchie, Joby Harold and Lionel Wigram, the movie is mostly about establishing Arthur¡¯s origin story, which turns on the usual reluctant hero coming to terms with his destiny, meaning Dad (Eric Bana) and Dad¡¯s mighty sword. This lineage and its burdens take a while to work through, primarily because this movie plays like the first installment in a hoped-for series. Merlin scarcely makes the scene, and Guinevere and Lancelot have yet to arrive to stir up trouble.The opener is a clotted visual mess, which isn¡¯t surprising. But it is disappointing just because the whole thing ¡ª the landscape, castle and so forth ¡ª is so drearily fake and ugly, even if the elephants are kind of amusing and it¡¯s always nice to see Mr. Bana.

After years in storage, the mighty ape with the big teeth and the thing for pale blondes has been dusted off and digitally turbocharged for ¡°Kong: Skull Island.¡± Once again, a lot of the noise and action involve guns, monsters and crashing jungle chases, but the most promising moments involve King Kong and the really little lady he unexpectedly meets. In the past, their brief encounter made for some strange moments, none weirder than in the original 1933 film when Kong pauses while undressing his human doll to smell his fingers.It was beauty that killed the beast, or so it has been repeatedly claimed. In 1933 it was Fay Wray¡¯s scantily clad beauty who took the rap for bringing Kong down off the top of the Empire State Building. (Fighter planes with machines guns helped.) By 1976, the beauty-beast relationship had grown rather more complicated, and Jessica Lange was weepily begging Kong to hold onto her. In the 2005 redo it was Naomi Watts¡¯s turn to shed tears for him. In ¡°Kong: Skull Island,¡± the big guy has a new look and a new gal pal, Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), who¡¯s somewhat feistier and certainly more sensibly dressed than her predecessors. She points and she shoots, and not just her camera. ¡°Skull Island¡± pretty much exhumes the same story conceived for the 1933 classic. This time, the adventurers include a group of government-backed scientists run by Bill Randa (John Goodman), who has his glinting eyes on a mysterious, seemingly unexplored island. Mysteries were made for solving, and this island, Randa reasons, may contain all manner of wonders, or perhaps something beyond human imagining. So, with a military unit led by Lt. Col. Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), the scientists ship out, accompanied by Mason, a no-nonsense war photographer who¡¯s soon trading barbs and looks with the world¡¯s prettiest mercenary, James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston). The filmmakers fold a lot of moody detail into the introductions, including real locations and the fog of war: The story takes place in 1973 and the movie was primarily shot in Vietnam. (It was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts from a script by Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein and Derek Connolly.) If the sweat, bantering grunts and teeming bars feel borrowed from innumerable other movies, they are also mostly on hand to get the story up and the characters running, which happens once the travelers pierce the thick clouds surrounding Skull Island. There, they meet the enemy and the enemy is ¡ª surprise ¡ª us, although there are plenty of digital terrors red in tooth and claw.Over the years, critics have pushed and pulled at ¡°King Kong,¡± denouncing its representation of the islanders (played by black actors in the 1933 film) and reading it metaphorically through black masculinity and white femininity. Later Kong movies have tried to sidestep criticism by changing the representation of the islanders while leaving beauty and the beast intact. Yet even as ¡°Skull Island¡± avoids some stereotypes, it embraces others, partly through a struggle that pits a pathological black character against a pair of white saviors. Kong, meanwhile, at times feels sidelined, brought out every so often to wreak havoc and briefly exchange soulful looks with Mason. ¡°Skull Island¡± has momentum, polish and behemoths that slither and thunder. The sets and creature designs are often beautifully filigreed, but the larger picture remains murky. Backed by government and guns, the scientists prove to be colonialists by another name, an idea that the filmmakers bat around a bit, including in allusions to Joseph Conrad¡¯s novella ¡°Heart of Darkness.¡± These references pad ¡°Skull Island,¡± giving audiences (and critics) something to chew on and help explain the repeated, near-fetishistic nods to ¡°Apocalypse Now,¡± Francis Ford Coppola¡¯s 1979 Vietnam-era retelling of the Conrad novel: the fireball sun, the military helicopters in formation and even a napalm attack.If that weren¡¯t enough, there¡¯s also a Dennis Hopper-like character right out of ¡°Apocalypse Now,¡± a loopy, grizzled survivor named Hank Marlow who is played by John C. Reilly in charming crazy mode (the narrator in ¡°Heart of Darkness is also a Marlow). Marlow pops up after Kong makes his star entrance swatting down helicopters and scattering survivors. Far larger than his forebears, Kong looks as big as a mountain here. Supersizing is a default mode of the contemporary blockbuster, but in this case a pumped-up Kong may have something to do with his role in an evolving studio franchise featuring monsters (a.k.a. MonsterVerse) that kicked off with the 2014 ¡°Godzilla.¡± If all goes according to corporate plan, Kong will be slugging it out with Godzilla soon enough. That doubtless excites studio executives and some fans, but the promise of a return engagement drains much of the pathos from Kong. In many ways ¡°Skull Island¡± looks and plays like its antecedents, despite the cosmetic tweaks, digital effects and attempts at inclusive casting. Like those earlier films, it too asks the critical question in many such tales ¡ª ¡°Mirror, mirror on the wall, who¡¯s the most monstrous of them all?¡± ¡ª through an ape who, because he¡¯s a close relative, turns our gaze back on ourselves. Kong is the beast we know, the beast we deny, the beast we fear, the beast we kill.Here, though, Kong is no longer the beast we love, the tragic captor-swain who, if he didn¡¯t always win the affections of his prisoners, achieved immortality by seducing viewers. ¡°Skull Island¡± is adept at goosing you; it deploys action-movie feints and horror-film frights capably amid its clich¨¦s and deaths. Every so often it also pauses and allows Kong and Mason to move you. As each recognizes the other, they bridge the divide, but perhaps because their relationship is more empathetic than romantic, these encounters don¡¯t have the resonance they should. Alas, beauty no longer has her beast, the beast no longer has his beauty and this darkness has no heart even if it will have a sequel.",0.9910889048431,"Action"

Nevertheless, in this film he cast two former Bresson ¡°models,¡± Anne Wiazemsky and Henri de Maublanc, as the lovers Elie and Jean Baptiste. The secret child of the title is, in a sense, the film itself, one in which, according to Mr. Garrel, he ¡°returned to autobiography¡± after a series of experimental features.But the movie does feature a little boy named Swann who belongs to Elie. The adorable blond moppet, she tells Jean-Baptiste, is the son of a film actor who refuses to acknowledge paternity, even though his mother is raising the child. It reflects Mr. Garrel¡¯s own long love affair with the musical artist Nico, who had a child she said was the son of the French film star Alain Delon. He never acknowledged the boy, but his parents largely raised the child in his early years.Ms. Wiazemsky and Mr. de Maublanc maintain a kind of Bressonian passivity in enacting the dank, entropic spiral that sucks their characters ever downward. They alternately try to maintain, or violently break away from, their intimacy. Mr. Garrel¡¯s approach to narrative here is deliberately provisional; he presents a number of story modules which fragmentedly depict Jean-Baptiste¡¯s mental breakdown, Elie¡¯s mourning over the death of her mother and the couple¡¯s flirtations with potential new lovers and dangerous drugs. Most sad stories of love in our culture express disappointed romanticism. In the world of Mr. Garrel, whose whole work can be seen as an inquiry into the nature of love, romanticism is crushed, slowly and inexorably, yet refuses to die fully. The movie¡¯s few moments of respite from this process are provided through brief shots of the couple walking hand in hand with Swann. Far longer are the shots of them on a park bench in the pouring rain, or sitting on a mattress on an apartment floor, framed by dingy off-white walls.Mr. Garrel¡¯s work has a unique aesthetic that today¡¯s American cinephiles seem to be hungry for; this movie¡¯s long-overdue release here is part of a longer retrospective at the Metrograph. One reason Mr. Garrel¡¯s earlier work has been hard to see in this country is that his early career was more or less as an underground filmmaker ¡ª one of the inspirations he cited during a recent New York appearance is Andy Warhol, whom he met through Nico. ¡°L¡¯Enfant Secret¡± forms a kind of bridge between his more abstract pictures and the narratives of the ¡¯80s and beyond, extending to his latest movie, ¡°Lover for a Day,¡± which was seen at the New York Film Festival and will have a theatrical run here next year.¡°L¡¯Enfant Secret¡± is shot in a black and white that is frequently out of focus, by a camera that¡¯s intentionally not entirely steady. Some shots are reiterated in the ultra-grainy form in which they might have been viewed as rushes, or through a Moviola. Part of Mr. Garrel¡¯s mastery is his ability to make expressive use of what would constitute dire technical flaws in other people¡¯s films.

Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy. It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the ¡°admissions process.¡± Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage. She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time. She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush). She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.You might think you¡¯ve seen this all before. You probably have, but never quite like this. What Ms. Gerwig has done ¡ª and it¡¯s by no means a small accomplishment ¡ª is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise. The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timoth¨¦e Chalamet). None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig. (Lady Bird is not always so kind.)The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument. Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted. It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family. The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larry¡¯s melancholy and Marion¡¯s ill humor. They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesn¡¯t always express itself as kindness. They are real people, honestly portrayed.That might make ¡°Lady Bird¡± sound drab and dutiful, but it¡¯s the opposite. I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is. I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits. I¡¯d tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail. I¡¯m tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.I¡¯ll settle for one: the bittersweet feeling of having watched someone grow in front of your eyes, into a different and in some ways improved version of herself. In life, that¡¯s a messy, endless process, which is one reason we need movies. Or to put it another way, even though Lady Bird will never be perfect, ¡°Lady Bird¡± is.",0.742620672739183,"Comedy"

You may think you know her, that she¡¯s the one who sleeps with death, the one pouring evil into her husband¡¯s ear. Certainly the invocation of Shakespeare tips that there¡¯s something dangerous about the lady of its house, an opaque beauty called Katherine (a very fine Florence Pugh). Yet part of this movie¡¯s ticklish nastiness is that at first it isn¡¯t at all clear whether she will be the master of doom or its helpmate. At just 17, Katherine looks like the innocent flower, but something wicked this way comes seductively, then savagely.Set in 1865 rural England, ¡°Lady Macbeth¡± opens with Katherine at the marriage altar, her head draped in a white veil that suggests virtue and slyly hints at the blood that will spill. She¡¯s soon in the bedroom with her husband, Alexander (Paul Hilton), a scowler with angry, accusatory eyes who isn¡¯t interested in her sexually or any other way. Their first night together, he brusquely orders her to undress, only to crawl into bed, leaving her naked, untouched and puzzled. This remains the template for a somewhat mysteriously cheerless, loveless marriage that finds Katherine more of a prisoner than a wife.Not much happens at first, beautifully. Katherine is soon bored, but the director, William Oldroyd, ensures that you aren¡¯t, with his use of sepulchral quiet, mesmerizingly steady framing and unnerving order, in which nothing is ever out of place, especially nothing human. There seem to be no books in the house, which is maintained by beaten-down servants and overseen by Alexander¡¯s even more unpleasant father, Boris (a good Christopher Fairbank). Everything looks superficially lovely, especially Katherine, who is brushed and cinched, primped and readied by her maid, Anna (Naomi Ackie), like a doll that no one plays with. It¡¯s unclear if Katherine can read; at times she barely speaks.For the most part, Katherine watches, and we watch her watching, as the quiet grows louder, and the stillness grows eerier. Bidden to stay indoors ¡ª somehow the fresh air would be bad for her, or so the men of the house insist ¡ª she spends much of her time staring out a window, a familiar pastime for repressed, yearning women in fiction. Of Madame Bovary, the theorist Stephen Heath wrote: ¡°The window is the frame of Emma¡¯s dissatisfaction.¡± The same holds true for Katherine, whose window reveals the life that she¡¯s been cut off from, even as it reminds her, day after lonely night, of the freedom on the other side of the glass. Something happens, of course, rocking Katherine, the story and the visual order. Alexander leaves ¡ª there¡¯s trouble at the family colliery ¡ª creating a void that she rapidly fills. She starts a bold, increasingly reckless affair with a groomsman, Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis), a rough number wildly out of his league and depth. Adultery soon begets murder, but even when Katherine is standing over a second corpse, it¡¯s not obvious whether she¡¯s a newly sprung prisoner of gender with a reasonable sociopolitical alibi (the patriarchy made her do it!) or just a psychopath in a fetching peacock-blue gown. Mr. Oldroyd doesn¡¯t tip his hand, forcing you to choose.The movie is based on ¡°Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,¡± an 1865 novella by Nikolai Leskov that Dmitri Shostakovich turned into an opera and Andrzej Wajda adapted into a film. Like the novella, the movie opens up some interpretive leeway as it invites your sympathy for Katherine. She¡¯s an unambiguous captive, trapped by sex and class, yet the viciousness that her liberation awakens ¡ª as carnal lust slips into bloodlust ¡ª precludes a facile redemptive reading. Mr. Oldroyd boxes Katherine in his attractive visuals, imprisoning her as her male relatives do. Yet his intellectual distance also turns her into a specimen, a pinned butterfly turned taxidermy beast.Written by Alice Birch, this version of ¡°Lady Macbeth¡± is most successfully complicated by Anna, a sympathetic character who doesn¡¯t exist in the novella but takes on mounting importance here. Katherine, having been radically isolated by her husband and father-in-law, has no friends. Anna is Katherine¡¯s closest companion by default and serves as maid and occasional minder; over time, Anna also becomes a moving, horrified witness to Katherine¡¯s crimes, emotion that warms the insistent chill. That Anna is played by a black actress, and Katherine by a white one, adds race to the thickening intrigue, making a story of female oppression and domination, power and privilege that much more harrowing and ugly.",0.894940703717839,"Drama"

Hillary Clinton is on television, sporting a hairband and a pink suit.Mostly, though, as the movie¡¯s title whimsically suggests, the mid-90s were an era of adorably quaint technology. Characters make calls from pay phones and listen to messages on answering machines. They take pictures with boxy little cameras, rent videocassettes of movies and make mix tapes on actual cassette tape. The members of an upper-middle-class New York household share a single desktop computer, with a dot-matrix printer and a slot for floppy disks.One of those antique data-storage devices provides the pretext for a bit of plot. Ali (Abby Quinn), the younger of the two Jacobs daughters, discovers a trove of erotic poetry her father has been writing to someone other than his wife. These proto-sexts are part of a small epidemic of infidelity among the Jacobses. Ali¡¯s older sister, Dana (Jenny Slate), recently engaged to her live-in boyfriend, Ben (Jay Duplass), sparks up some action on the side with Nate (Finn Wittrock), a guy she knew in college. ¡°We¡¯re a family of cheaters,¡± Ali says in disgust.¡°Landline¡± was directed by Gillian Robespierre, who wrote it with Elisabeth Holm. They also collaborated on ¡°Obvious Child,¡± which starred Ms. Slate, and which was notable for the mixture of sweetness and candor it brought to the subject of abortion. There was something bracing, as well as brave, about that film¡¯s honesty. Oddly, the new one is much more cautious and decorous in its treatment of the emotional dynamics of a complicated family. For all the profanity and naughty behavior, it has the timid, ingratiating vibe of a television sitcom, sticking to safe and familiar emotional territory. Or, more to the point, it might remind oldish viewers of a certain kind of observant, clever but unambitious independent film that came to prominence in the era it depicts. The characters are not badly drawn, but they stay within the lines. Dana is the flakier sister, and also the more responsible one. Ali is quiet, guarded and critical. She is both more reckless and more grounded than her parents suspect.The parents, meanwhile, are near-caricatures of middle-aged compromise. Alan (John Turturro) clings to his literary ambitions and works at an advertising agency. His wife, Pat (Edie Falco), works in environmental policy but doesn¡¯t talk much about it. They refer to a wilder life back in the ¡¯70s, but, like much else in the movie, that feels more like a talking point than like an aspect of authentic experience.Mr. Turturro and Ms. Falco, with their lived-in faces and deeply seasoned acting technique, provide Alan and Pat with more individuality than the script does. The filmmakers seem hesitant to make any of their characters too interesting. Each one is an assemblage of surface quirks and emotional responses, neatly inserted into a series of dramatic and comic situations. Some of these pay off nicely, in particular when Ms. Slate and Ms. Quinn share the screen and capture the jumpy, push-and-pull rhythms of loving but not entirely compatible sisters.It¡¯s strange to think that if Ali and Dana were real, they would now be in their early and later 40s. The fact that they seem so much like present-day young people is less an anachronism than an aspect of the film¡¯s hopeful, soothing attitude. It¡¯s a peace offering from Generation X to the millennials, a gesture of solidarity from one cohort of the metropolitan upper-middle class to another.

At his best ¡ª most canonically in the ¡°Before¡± trilogy but also in films like ¡°Slacker,¡± ¡°Dazed and Confused¡± and ¡°Waking Life¡± ¡ª he quiets the engine of plot, keeps the camera at a polite, attentive distance and lets people talk. The content of the conversations is important, but so are the more subtle kinds of information that human speech conveys: the unstated emotions and idiosyncrasies of character that flow alongside and underneath the words.¡°Last Flag Flying,¡± Mr. Linklater¡¯s new feature, is a suite for three voices. It¡¯s a lot of other things, too. A war movie, in its way, and also a road picture and a memory play. Set in 2003, at the stage of the Iraq war when we were assured that the mission was being handily accomplished, it brings together three Vietnam veterans for a somber task. Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) are former Marines. Larry Shepherd (Steve Carell) ¡ª his nickname was Doc ¡ª served in the Navy. Long-buried bad memories shadow their reunion and complicate their camaraderie, and the circumstances of their meeting dredges up the painful and complex legacy of their not-so-long-ago war.Back then, Doc served time in the brig and received a bad-conduct discharge ¡ª he mordantly calls it a ¡°better career decision¡± ¡ª a fact that connects ¡°Last Flag Flying¡± to an earlier work, Hal Ashby¡¯s ¡°The Last Detail.¡± That movie, released in 1973 and starring Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid and Otis Young, was based on a novel by Darryl Ponicsan, whose sequel to that book is the basis of Mr. Linklater¡¯s film. (Mr. Linklater and Mr. Ponicsan collaborated on the screenplay.)¡°Last Flag Flying¡± is not a literal continuation of ¡°The Last Detail.¡± The names of the men and the details of their shared back story have been changed. A petty theft has been replaced by something grimmer and more specifically tied to Vietnam. But the new movie echoes its predecessor in shape and to some degree in mood. The three men make their way up the Eastern Seaboard, mostly by train, toward Portsmouth, N.H., stopping along the way to break up the trip and vary the scenery. Portsmouth is where Doc did his time, and also where he married and raised the son whose burial is the purpose of the journey. The young man, who had enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school, died in Baghdad in what the military officially described as an ambush. Doc has sought out his old buddies ¡ª though the nature of their friendship is one of many ambiguities ¡ª to help bring his boy home. He refuses the offer of burial at Arlington National Cemetery, a choice that frustrates an officious colonel (Yul Vazquez) but that must nonetheless be honored. A member of the son¡¯s company (J. Quinton Johnson) accompanies the older men. ¡°Last Flag Flying¡± often plays less like a tragedy than a low-key comedy in a tragic frame. Doc, Sal and Mueller are a perhaps too-perfectly mismatched set of contrasting styles and attitudes. Doc, younger than the other two ¡ª he was just a kid when they all first got mixed up together ¡ª is the quietest, a timid soul trying not to shrivel up with grief. Sal is the wild man, a motor mouth whose high spirits, you feel, could turn into violent rage in the blink of an eye. Mueller is a reformed hell-raiser who shut the door on his past, sobered up and found a measure of peace as a minister and the patriarch of a thriving family.The three have a lot to talk about, and they also leave a lot unsaid. Mr. Linklater avoids flashbacks and other obvious ways of connecting the film¡¯s present to its implied past. We don¡¯t see any combat, either in Iraq or Vietnam, which gives the verbal accounts of what happened in those places extra weight and mystery. There is some political venting ¡ª none of which fits in a tidy ideological box ¡ª but mostly a lot of bluster, chops-busting and reminiscing to pass the time.The time doesn¡¯t always pass easily, though. The film, like the characters, feels like it¡¯s working things out as it goes along. This is sometimes fascinating and sometimes frustrating. The performances don¡¯t always connect. Mr. Cranston, leaning into a New York accent, his hands and face perpetually in motion, has the busy energy of a stage actor. Mr. Fishburne is a master of stillness, and the dissonance between them isn¡¯t just a matter of the differences between Sal and Mueller. I never made the imaginative leap from performance to reality. The actors somehow got in the way of the characters. But even if ¡°Last Flag Flying¡± isn¡¯t quite persuasive, it is nonetheless enormously thought-provoking, and its roughness is a sign of how earnestly it grapples with matters that other movies about war prefer not to think about. It is about the much-discussed division between members of the military and the rest of society, and also about the less frequently acknowledged conflicts within and among those who fight. It uses the language of heroism and sacrifice to challenge popular, sentimental notions of what those things mean, and to connect individual ethics with collective morality. None of that is easy, and what may be hardest to bear is the awareness that a country can sometimes look smaller than the people who serve it.",0.999252024790075,"Comedy"

It couldn¡¯t have been easy. He¡¯s nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy ¡ª an actor¡¯s landscape ¡ª while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an ¡°unconditional war¡± on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnson¡¯s road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nation¡¯s healer after John F. Kennedy¡¯s death. It¡¯s a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment it¡¯s 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office. Mr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether he¡¯s barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. He¡¯s fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasn¡¯t thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in ¡°Point Break.¡± It¡¯s a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking. Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstone¡¯s script, ¡°LBJ¡± is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelson¡¯s talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but he¡¯s booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. That¡¯s too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies ¡ª ¡°Selma,¡± ¡°Jackie,¡± ¡°Marshall¡± ¡ª that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, ¡°LBJ¡± doesn¡¯t look all that different from most other great-man stories. Yet there are moments ¡ª Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins ¡ª when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white, male power bare in all its ugliness. In scenes like these, the movie inches around complexity even as it continues to clear the way for another make-believe savior.",0.0801632034185799,"Biography"

This movie focuses on her time in the Middle East during the early 20th century and her role in drawing the modern borders of Iraq, which the United States and other countries have expended a good deal of blood and treasure to maintain and defend.The directors asked the redoubtable Tilda Swinton to read Bell¡¯s letters, and, in configuring the film as if it were made after Bell¡¯s death in 1926, they cast actors in the roles of Bell¡¯s contemporaries, such as T.

Over the decades these types have changed their looks and histories, but there¡¯s a sameness to how they escape the law and the routine hum of everyday life; how they use guns ruthlessly or reluctantly; skip out on church yet live by their own moral code; and inevitably rise to become masters of their worlds, as well as of the most beautiful women in the room. They¡¯re fantasies of power partly because no matter how hard this type falls, his power never truly corrupts.That¡¯s more or less what Mr. Affleck is hawking in ¡°Live by Night,¡± a gangster movie set in the 1920s. He plays Joe Coughlin, a World War I veteran who¡¯s returned from the war with a mouth full of tough-guy talk that basically boils down to, ¡°I went away a soldier, I came home an outlaw.¡± Mr. Affleck recites this line with a gravelly hush, as if he were spilling a secret, but whatever Joe has learned in the bloody fields of Europe remains mostly obscured; what speaks loudly is his proficiency with a gun and the easy way in which he shoots at a man in a uniform, even if that man wears a badge. ¡°Live by Night¡± is a messy, unfocused movie about ambition, lost ideals, corrupt men and a thief whose idea of life on his own terms means pulling the trigger. It has Tommy guns and Model T¡¯s, luxuriously polished surfaces, some fine squealing-tire action and a handful of solid performances, including one from Sienna Miller, who tramps around as a 10-cents-a-dance cynic. But what¡¯s most striking about the movie is its earnestness. Mr. Affleck isn¡¯t playing with genre for kicks or as a knowing, reflexive exercise, but trying to pour new wine into a bullet-riddled vessel. This is harder to pull off than it looks, especially if ¡ª as Mr. Affleck does here ¡ª you¡¯re trying to say something important about homegrown myths involving progress and exceptionalism. One hurdle is that our gangster movies are almost by definition about the dark side of the American dream, one that sexes up the Horatio Alger fairy tale with sin and violence only to then sometimes toss Horatio and his dream in the gutter. James Cagney machine-gunned his way to that dream in ¡°The Public Enemy¡± in 1931. Decades later, an aggrieved father opened ¡°The Godfather¡± with his own singular pledge of allegiance: ¡°I believe in America.¡±Based on a Dennis Lehane novel that shares the same title, ¡°Live by Night¡± tracks Joe from his early Boston crime sprees and Oedipal issues to his escalating involvement in a crime syndicate. (Brendan Gleeson pops up early on as Joe¡¯s policeman father.) Joe eventually lands in Tampa, Fla., where he builds a Prohibition empire, tangles with the sheriff (Chris Cooper) and falls in love with a local attraction (Zoe Saldana) who changes his ideas about life. There are complications, involving the sheriff¡¯s daughter (Elle Fanning), other gangsters and the Ku Klux Klan, all of which are crammed amid intrigues, locations, cinematic homages and too many self-flattering scenes for Mr. Affleck. Mr. Affleck handles the busy narrative without finding its hook, but his biggest problem is that he¡¯s fallen for his leading man. He gave himself a good role in ¡°Argo,¡± one of the earlier movies he directed (in the first, ¡°Gone Baby Gone,¡± he stayed off camera). But in ¡°Argo,¡± he was also embedded in that movie¡¯s enjoyably loony complications and upstaged by a couple of world-class scene-stealers in Alan Arkin and John Goodman. In ¡°Live by Night,¡± by contrast, Mr. Affleck grabs the center and doesn¡¯t let go, partly, it seems, because he¡¯s invested in being a movie star. (Certainly that¡¯s the only rational explanation for ¡°Batman v Superman,¡± other than the paycheck.)Joe¡¯s rise becomes progressively lucrative, uglier and more brutal, but Mr. Affleck has never been an actor who can persuasively go for the jugular and he can¡¯t help but smooth the rough edges. This softening undercuts some of Mr. Affleck¡¯s big moments, as when Joe faces down a Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, a scene that ends up feeling more about affirming Joe¡¯s superiority than advancing the story. At that moment and elsewhere, Joe scarcely seems the complex, conflicted man who lives by night even as he¡¯s increasingly drawn into the day. He comes off like a different fantasy, one that¡¯s a shotgun wedding between 20th-century pulp clich¨¦s and 21st-century elevated political consciousness. Such moments weigh down ¡°Live by Night,¡± making its heaviness ponderous. At the same time, there¡¯s something appealing in how Mr. Affleck comes at the gangster genre and how this story departs from the tribal affiliations of films like ¡°The Departed¡± toward a more pluralistic vision in tune with both today¡¯s and yesterday¡¯s United States. In ¡°Live by Night,¡± Joe ends up thriving in a mixed neighborhood and rubbing elbows with people of different hues, yet this is scarcely an advertisement for so-called political correctness. If anything, he¡¯s just another regular Joe, robbing, killing and swaggering his way to the American dream one bullet at a time.",0.518521815030875,"Crime"

It¡¯s another entry in the tireless X-Men saga but doesn¡¯t play like a retread or an ad for the next installment; instead, it plays, looks and sounds like a movie ¡ª an old-school meets new-school pulp filled with intimations of mortality, and raw, ugly violence. Once again, Hugh Jackman has saddled up to play the Wolverine, a mutant who also goes by Logan, and has always been the most satisfying character in the series. Mr. Jackman¡¯s charm can lighten the glummest dirge, but for comic-book agnostics the real appeal is Logan¡¯s reluctance to get involved, an ambivalence that can feel familiar to viewers exhausted by the same fight. This is the ninth time that Mr. Jackman has played Logan, and while the character¡¯s claws are intact, the movie is a major narrative and stylistic shift in its franchise universe. It was directed by James Mangold, who shares script credit with Scott Frank and Michael Green, and has the clarity and directness of a classic genre picture. It¡¯s part western, part neo-noir, the kind of movie in which a stranger steps from the shadows and shakes off his isolation and existential burden long enough to right whatever wrong needs righting. You know him: He¡¯s the man with the tight smile and split lip, the one whose hard talk never fully obscures his wounded soul.The opener is kinetic, efficiently staged, casually sadistic and near-ritualistic in how it conforms to the genre playbook. Logan is napping in his parked car not far from the United States-Mexico border when he is awakened by a gang trying to steal his tires. It¡¯s an archetypal poke-the-bear scene, the sort in which the hero announces his bona fides by eradicating villains too stupid to know what they are up against. Logan calls out to them, as if giving them fair warning. It¡¯s pointless. Like most generic bad guys, these exist purely to wind the hero up ¡ª they¡¯re the action-movie equivalent of foreplay ¡ª and soon Logan is slicing and dicing, spearing bodies like kebabs. Scenes like these turn characters into garbage that the hero has to bag up and toss. That¡¯s standard genre posturing, but Logan is as much a hero as an outlier and can¡¯t descend into nihilism. He needs a cause, a banner to hoist. So the movie complicates its bloodletting, including through a story line about corporate violence run amok in a near-lawless future. Enter the rogue geneticist (played with restrained flair by Richard E. Grant) with a venal aide-de-camp (a charismatic Boyd Holbrook) and an army of paramilitary cyborgs. These, in turn, connect to Laura (a terrific newcomer, Dafne Keen), a watchful, feral child who is fleeing across borders. Before long, Logan is playing the resistant head of a household that includes Laura as the ultimate in uncontrollable spawn and a sickly Professor X (Patrick Stewart) as their noble paterfamilias. Mr. Stewart, using a rasp that suggests decay is working its way out from the inside, does some beautiful work, especially with Mr. Jackman. Pushing and pulling at each other, they create a shared vulnerability that¡¯s expressed both in physical degradations ¡ª the movie is filled with ravaged, traumatized bodies ¡ª and in the contrapuntal play between Logan¡¯s gruff tenderness and Professor X¡¯s floundering. (He¡¯s Gramps by way of King Lear.)Much of ¡°Logan¡± is an extended chase sequence, with Logan et al. forced on the run while pursued by the corporate concern. There are detours and kind strangers, open skies and endless miles, carnage and politics. En route, Mr. Mangold occasionally resorts to clich¨¦, but many of his choices feel fresh, paradoxically because he has the heart of a classicist. He has watched his share of Clint Eastwood and old Hollywood, too. He¡¯s also a sentimentalist, as his nod to the 1953 western ¡°Shane¡± suggests. (¡°A gun is a tool,¡± that film¡¯s gunslinger says, ¡°as good or as bad as the man using it.¡±) The romance of the righteous kill remains a cinematic article of faith.¡°Logan¡± is a strong argument for bringing the comic-book movie down to earth. It solidly hits its marks as it moves the franchise furniture around, and features striking special-effects scenes in which the world shudders to a near standstill. Here, though, the pyrotechnics serve the story and are of a piece with a scaled-down realism that acknowledges ¡ª in its scars, viscera and flood of parentless children ¡ª the cost of the endless fight. It loves that fight, of course: That¡¯s entertainment. But as it intimately tethers you to Logan and Laura, at times uncomfortably (their claws were made for impaling), it reminds you that these mutants are never less than human.",0.69139861868033,"Action"

In a land of winners and losers, where life is acknowledged to be unfair and positive thinking is all-powerful, we often find fault (or solace) not in our social structures but in our stars.¡°Logan Lucky,¡± Steven Soderbergh¡¯s gravity-defying, ridiculously entertaining new film ¡ª one that ends a blessedly brief retirement from big-screen directing ¡ª concerns itself with a desperate attempt to even the odds. It¡¯s a caper movie, a modern-day Robin Hood tale organized around an elaborate, improbable but curiously plausible heist. A gang that includes a wounded veteran, an unemployed former coal miner, a hairdresser and other motley members of the noncoastal nonelite conspires to knock over a Nascar race sponsored by Coca-Cola. The event sucks a lot of cash from people like them, and the thieves quite literally set out to suck it right back up.That description might make the movie sound more pointed than it is. But Mr. Soderbergh¡¯s class consciousness ¡ª something that has popped up often in his career, in ¡°Erin Brockovich¡± and ¡°The Girlfriend Experience,¡± in ¡°Bubble¡± and, of course, in ¡°Magic Mike¡± ¡ª is atmospheric rather than programmatic. Nobody in ¡°Logan Lucky¡± utters a political word, but the setting carries a heavy, obvious charge of political significance all the same. The Logans in question are proud, hard-pressed residents of West Virginia, a state that, in the real world, punches far above its demographic weight in partisan and symbolic importance. Their land is beautiful and their water is contaminated. The film¡¯s anthem is John Denver¡¯s ¡°Take Me Home, Country Roads,¡± a hillbilly elegy if ever there was one.Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), who plays the song for his young daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), while they work on his pickup truck, knows that its authenticity is questionable. Two of the credited writers, he says, had probably never even been to West Virginia when they hymned the beauty of its valleys and rivers. (¡°Logan Lucky,¡± it should probably be pointed out, was shot mostly in Georgia.) But Jimmy also knows that even pop-culture artifice can carry a spore of genuine sentiment, and Mr. Soderbergh shows a similar faith in the impure products of America. A student of movie traditions high and low, he draws his inspiration here less from the gritty, downbeat realism of ¡¯70s New Hollywood than from that decade¡¯s good-time populist genre hybrids. If the ¡°Oceans¡± series represented his updating of Kennedy-era Rat Pack swagger, ¡°Logan Lucky¡± revives the irreverent, hell-raising outlaw vibe of ¡°Smokey and the Bandit.¡± Not that this movie feels in any way like a throwback. Mr. Tatum is about 10 times sexier than Burt Reynolds ever was, and about one-tenth as vain. Since his early screen appearances (in ¡°Step Up¡± and ¡°A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints¡±), it¡¯s been evident that he is a singularly charismatic performer, but by now it should be clear that he¡¯s also a great actor. I think his appeal has less to do with any supposed Everyman quality (though every man can dream, of course) than with an uncanny ability to convey irony and sincerity in the same gesture, to balance his effortless magnetism with unforced modesty. Jimmy, once a high school football star, has not quite resigned himself to life on the short end of the stick. Laid off from a construction job in North Carolina, he returns home to discover that his ex-wife (Katie Holmes) and her car-dealer husband (David Denman) are planning to move out of West Virginia with Sadie. Jimmy¡¯s brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), a bartender who lost a hand in Iraq, thinks the family is cursed. Jimmy doesn¡¯t share this superstition, and in any case he has a plan, or at least a how-to list for bank robbers that he decides to adapt for new circumstances.Like George Clooney¡¯s Danny Ocean, he needs, first of all, to put together a crew. Starting with Clyde and their sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), Jimmy taps into another kinship network, recruiting an explosives expert named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and his two brothers (Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson). That¡¯s not quite everyone, but there are some dandy little surprises in store that I¡¯m not inclined to spoil.Not that the plot is anything earth-shakingly original. ¡°Logan Lucky¡± sticks to the ¡°Oceans¡± template so faithfully that someone makes a joke about it. Who cares? The pleasures of the heist genre are always procedural and specific. These movies are all the same, but also always different because of the particular mix of personalities and circumstances. What they celebrate, above all, is the combination of craft, planning and problem-solving ingenuity that can turn a job of work into a work of art. They are, in other words, the quintessential movie movies, reflecting the collaborative challenges and logistical triumphs of the production cycle. For that reason, a good heist movie can settle into a sweet spot where reality and fantasy converge. This one¡¯s narrative engine hums along nicely, occasionally accelerating into farce, usually when Mr. Craig shows up, sporting neck tattoos, spiky bleached hair and an accent that sounds like the cause or the result of a badly sprained tongue. (The dialects are all over the map, but let¡¯s not get too hung up on authenticity.)Mr. Soderbergh never speeds through the twists and bumps. He downshifts and pulls onto the shoulder, letting the story take care of itself while the audience enjoys the sometimes funny, sometimes fractious, sometimes wistful pleasure of the characters¡¯ company. By the time you encounter Hilary Swank¡¯s F.B.I. agent, or figure out that the obnoxious British energy-drink mogul who is the only truly villainous character is Seth MacFarlane, you feel like you¡¯re a family-reunion crasher who stuck around long enough to get promoted to second cousin.Of the three movies released this summer that self-consciously reactivate an old-school outlaw mythology ¡ª the others are Edgar Wright¡¯s ¡°Baby Driver¡± and Josh and Benny Safdie¡¯s ¡°Good Time¡± ¡ª this one has the most to say and the least to prove. Whereas the other directors aggressively promote their own coolness, flaunting borrowed attitudes and showy retrofitted styles, Mr. Soderbergh revels in squareness, and in a loose self-confidence that disguises its mastery. ¡°Logan Lucky¡± is a terrific movie. That¡¯s a matter of skill, and maybe also of luck. But mostly it¡¯s a matter of generosity.",0.914661035033794,"Comedy"

And what if the bullet that killed him had been fired by someone else?A long and arduous labor of love by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman, the film turns van Gogh¡¯s work into an unusual kind of biopic. Using tens of thousands of oil paintings commissioned from scores of artists, the filmmakers transform famous works of modern art into a hypnotic and beguiling cartoon. The people van Gogh rendered on canvas ¡ª the provincial French functionaries, doctors, barmaids and farmers immortalized on museum walls ¡ª are brought to uncanny life, with the voices of professional actors, some of them well known.

Armand travels to Paris and then to Auvers-sur-Oise, the northern French town where Vincent died, leaving behind contradictory memories among the people he painted in his final years. They recall a passionate, hard-working artist, but not always the tormented, suicidal genius of legend. That legend has been sustained by earlier movies, notably Vincente Minnelli¡¯s rumbustious ¡°Lust for Life¡± (with Kirk Douglas as van Gogh) and Robert Altman¡¯s more cerebral ¡°Vincent & Theo¡± (starring Tim Roth and Paul Rhys as the brothers).Vincent himself (Robert Gulaczyk) is a more elusive presence in ¡°Loving Vincent,¡± since most of its action is posthumous and self-portraits make up a relatively small part of his oeuvre. There are flashbacks, but the painter is evoked mainly through the dialogue of the other characters, as if he were the Maltese Falcon.The principal mystery is the stuff of police procedural, as Armand doggedly tries to reconstruct van Gogh¡¯s final weeks and shed light on the circumstances of his death. How miserable was he, and why? What secrets did he harbor? What enemies had he made?The questions are interesting, but not quite sufficiently dramatized to sustain ¡°Loving Vincent¡± for its full length.

Julian Rosefeldt¡¯s ¡°Manifesto,¡± which originated as an art installation, has toured the world, recently roosting at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan. It consists of filmed readings of various artistic and political manifestoes, dating from Marx and Engels¡¯s 1848 ¡°Communist Manifesto¡± and moving through the 20th century to Dada, Fluxus and even Lars von Trier¡¯s Dogme 95 rules for filmmaking.In installation form, 13 readings play out simultaneously on 13 screens, challenging the viewer to pluck coherence from an audiovisual Babel of sorts. In the movie version, the scenes are laid out in a linear fashion, but one scene is divided so that the film begins and ends with it.The manifestoes (the film draws from many more than 13 texts; some are merely one-line maxims) are not just read, they¡¯re performed. And they¡¯re all presented by the chameleonic actress Cate Blanchett. More than a performer, Ms. Blanchett is also a movie star, albeit a very particular caliber of movie star. Which is one of several reasons ¡°Manifesto¡± works as well as it does in cinematic form. Some of the settings are on the nose, but that does not mean they are ineffective. The Dada manifesto, announcing the death of art, is set at a funeral. Claes Oldenburg¡¯s incantatory brief for pop art (¡°I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical¡±) is said as a prayer at the table of a family meal. (That the family is staid and middle-class and Southern tilts to a certain irony, however.) In some cases, the words and actions are at odds. For the Fluxus manifesto, which denounces hierarchical culture and the elevated position of the artist within that culture, Ms. Blanchett vehemently enacts the text in the guise of a temperamental, overbearing Russian choreographer. The juxtaposition of words, images and settings is sometimes brilliantly comedic, as when Ms. Blanchett, portraying a big-haired TV news anchor with a smile that looks as if it were enforced by law, converses about Conceptual art with a remote weather reporter, also played by Ms. Blanchett.As an installation, ¡°Manifesto¡± may have seemed like a sensory onslaught. As a movie, it¡¯s a very elaborate intellectual exercise, immaculate in every technical detail. (The sound design, by Fabian Schmidt and Markus Stemler, is particularly extraordinary.) And Ms. Blanchett¡¯s work here is aptly cerebral. As virtuosic as her performances are, they¡¯re purposely conscious of themselves. As an oblique examination and critique of political and art history and their various interactions over the 20th century, ¡°Manifesto¡± is both witty and provocative.

Just so we¡¯re clear: I¡¯m describing the premise of a new movie starring Liam Neeson. What did you think?The movie is ¡°Mark Felt ¡ª the Man Who Brought Down the White House,¡± and the headlines from which it was ripped are more than four decades old. The title sounds like a category error, since the White House, as of this writing, is still standing. But Mark Felt, though almost nobody knew back in the ¡¯70s, was undoubtedly instrumental in ending the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. The associate director of the F.B.I. at the time of the Watergate burglary, Felt entered the annals of Nixon-era scandal as Deep Throat, a pseudonym bestowed by the Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward.Felt, who didn¡¯t much like the name, identified himself as Mr. Woodward¡¯s source in 2005. The memoir he published before his death in 2008 has been turned, by the writer and director Peter Landesman, a former journalist, into a hectic, intermittently intriguing and accidentally timely procedural thriller, with Mr. Neeson in the title role. His face as sharp as the blade of a hatchet, his brow creased with his weariness and his eyes ablaze with indignation, Mr. Neeson is a mighty presence on a small, cramped stage. The word Shakespearean often attaches itself to the Nixon administration ¡ª it¡¯s an adjective that marks the place where political power intersects with moral instability ¡ª and ¡°Mark Felt¡± tries to infuse some dramatic grandeur into what is in essence a chronicle of bureaucratic scheming. The president and most of the president¡¯s men are rarely seen and only occasionally heard over the phone. Felt and his F.B.I. colleagues hustle in and out of offices, whisper in corridors and ride in dark, period-appropriate sedans. For the benefit of viewers who may have trouble distinguishing one white guy in a suit from another (the earnest and talented supporting cast includes Josh Lucas, Tony Goldwyn, Ike Barinholtz and Brian d¡¯Arcy James), they often address one another by full name and title. Even for die-hard Watergate nerds, the movie can be a tough slog. The main conflict is between Felt and his new boss, L. Patrick Gray (Marton Csokas), who Felt comes to believe is functioning as Nixon¡¯s mole in the F.B.I., and who also wants to limit the bureau¡¯s Watergate inquiries. (Gray is also the man who took the job Felt thought should have been his, and wounded pride may be among his motives.) Meanwhile, on the home front, Felt and his long-suffering, heavy-drinking wife, Audrey (Diane Lane), worry about their daughter, who has vanished into the mists of the counterculture. There is a potentially interesting tension between Felt¡¯s professional duties and his personal life that never fully takes shape.¡°Mark Felt¡± is a sharp portrait set against a blurry background, a history lesson that won¡¯t help you on the test. It is possible to savor the crags and shadows of Mr. Neeson¡¯s performance without quite grasping why Mr. Landesman thinks the story is worthy of such somber, serious and sustained attention. Both the internal politics of the F.B.I. in the aftermath of J. Edgar Hoover¡¯s death and the larger political and social dramas of the late ¡¯60s and early ¡¯70s are invoked, but neither the national nor the institutional stakes are illuminated with sufficient clarity or force.",0.827471481746043,"Biography"

With economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances, it revisits an early episode from the life of Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. From the 1940s to the early ¡¯60s, he argued 32 cases before the court, winning most. ¡°Sometimes history takes things into its own hands,¡± Marshall once said, but he also regularly gave history a shove.¡°Marshall¡± isn¡¯t about the famous cases that he argued in front of the court, including the history-making Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which led the court to declare racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. Instead, the movie focuses on a 1941 case involving Eleanor Strubing, a wealthy white woman from Greenwich, Conn., who accused her black chauffeur and butler, Joseph Spell, of raping her and then pushing her off a bridge. After hours of questioning, Spell confessed. The racist reactions to the charges, which invoked the dangerous Jim Crow stereotype of the ravaging black man, caught the notice of N.A.A.C.P., which sent Marshall to the rescue.Jauntily self-possessed, the movie¡¯s Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) rides in like a cavalry of one, taking the measure of the town and its escalating tension. He¡¯s soon joined by another lawyer, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), a button-down type who reluctantly joins the defense and reasonably fears the attention it will bring. The pair¡¯s introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags, and Sam ends up carrying the load. The scene telegraphs the shifting power dynamics Thurgood represents, but it also announces that the movie will resort to easy, ingratiating comedy to sell the goods.Seamlessly directed by Reginald Hudlin from a script by the father-and-son team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff, the movie primarily involves Thurgood¡¯s strategy to free Joseph. Part of what made the case important to the N.A.A.C.P., as the scholar Daniel J. Sharfstein has written, was that it took place in the North instead of the South, where the organization was fighting on multiple fronts. In the 1930s, the activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that the idea that there was no prejudice in the North was a fable. ¡°The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation,¡± he wrote in 1934, ¡°is largely a difference of degree.¡± ¡°Marshall¡± takes up that refrain both in its restaging of the trial and through the evolution of Thurgood and Sam¡¯s slow-warming relationship. As the case comes into focus, Joseph (Sterling K. Brown) and Eleanor (Kate Hudson) take their opposing seats, the jury troops in, and the nasty judge (James Cromwell) starts snarling. Thurgood rapidly takes the lead while slyly poking and strategically prodding Sam to rise to the occasion. Thurgood and Sam banter, lash out, jostle for position and occasionally deliver some stink eye, especially Sam (at Thurgood). Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief. Both performers are natural showmen who never step on each other¡¯s moment; they¡¯re fun to watch.It¡¯s all a bit too much fun at times. The chuckles and legal-eagle bromance make the difficult, disturbing story flow easily, but there are moments when you wish that Mr. Hudlin would ease up on the comedy. Sam, in particular, occasionally comes uncomfortably close to a being a caricature, one of those bespectacled, emasculated types who need a kick in the pants, a sock in the jaw, so they can man up. The broadness of the characterizations is of a piece with the movie¡¯s anxious rhythms and relentless forward drive. These may be a function of the clock running out on Joseph, along with a desire to entertain. But there¡¯s little reflective or quiet time with the characters, these men of righteous action who chase clues before swooping into court and history.¡°Marshall¡± also stumbles somewhat with the he-said, she-said wrangling. The filmmakers effortlessly lay out the very real existential dangers threatening Joseph, whose fate rests either with Thurgood or the howling white mob outside. But the overly broad performances, especially in the zippy courtroom scenes, drain the movie of nuance and blunt its realism, and the contrapuntal his-and-her flashbacks add little. Ms. Hudson¡¯s performance, with its brassy and brittle notes, and its counterfeit hauteur, comes perilously close to cartoonish. She doesn¡¯t do much for courtroom suspense, and neither does the irresistible Mr. Brown, a world-class scene-stealer whose quavering voice and pleadingly earnest eyes make the strongest case by far.",0.969941703533088,"Biography"

He¡¯s constantly berated by his boss and others, and their criticisms aren¡¯t always without cause: Menashe is often late and prone to blunders, and is usually short of money.Outside of his job, he has a bigger worry: regaining custody of his son. Menashe is a widower, and his orthodox Jewish faith requires him to raise his child, Rieven (Ruben Niborski), in a home with a mother. A rabbi has decreed that until Menashe remarries, Rieven must live with an aunt and uncle. That same rabbi, however, has allowed father and son to spend a week together before Rieven returns to those relatives.Over the week, the two bond, argue and work, all of it shown with a naturalism that can be clumsy or graceful, but it always feels authentic. One mostly silent scene, showing them simply spending time with each other, is moving in its affection. Another scene, when Menashe is on a date arranged by a matchmaker, generates both winces and laughs. Joshua Z.

But we, at least, are in a position to analyze the abundantly available clues and figure out who everybody is, the poet and his lady included. Or if not quite who they are, then at least what they represent. Because though this extravagant conversation piece of a movie, written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, feints toward psychological thriller territory and spends a delicious half-hour or so in the realm of domestic farce, it plants its flag defiantly on the wind-swept peak of religious (and ecological) allegory.I don¡¯t mean this in the vague, Superman-is-really-a-messiah-figure term paper sense of the word. At a certain point ¡ª it will vary according to your Sunday school attendance or what you remember from freshman English ¡ª you will find yourself in possession of the key to the analogical storage room where the Real Meaning resides. Up until that point, you might have thought this was a marital melodrama set in a nightmarish version of a ¡¯50s academic marriage. When Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer show up, you might mistake ¡°Mother!¡± for a savage, scrambled ¡°Who¡¯s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?¡± adaptation. But then, sometime between the first violent death and the collapse of the kitchen sink, you realize that something else is going on.Here I must confess a different kind of puzzlement. Is there such a thing as interpretive spoiler? Is it wrong to reveal a movie¡¯s conceit, rather than elements of its story? Ordinarily, such questions would be absurd, but Mr. Aronofsky ingeniously braids his movie¡¯s hermeneutic structure into its plot, making it hard to say what it¡¯s about without revealing what happens. All of the suspense and most of the fun in ¡°Mother!¡± ¡ª and don¡¯t listen to anyone who natters on about how intense or disturbing it is; it¡¯s a hoot! ¡ª has to do with the elaboration and execution of a central idea. Once you grasp that idea, you are left wondering just how far Mr. Aronofsky will go with it. The answer is all the way and then some ¡ª from Genesis to Revelation and back again. The house is referred to early in the film as ¡°paradise¡±; Ms. Lawrence refers to a relatively minor mess as an ¡°apocalypse.¡± These are more teasers than jokes, and the punch lines arrive with mesmerizing literalness. Holy Eucharist, Batman! Not that Mr. Aronofsky follows any known doctrinal path, any more than he did in ¡°Noah,¡± which upset some believers by taking liberties with its scriptural source. ¡°Mother!¡± casts a wider net, gathering influences from cinema ¡ª Roman Polanski, Stanley Kubrick, Gaspar No¨¦ ¡ª from literature and, most strikingly, from painting. Mr. Aronofsky and his usual cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, conduct a master class in light, shadow and Renaissance art. Ms. Lawrence glows like an Italian Madonna, while the deep lines in Mr. Bardem¡¯s face and the sorrowful cast of his eyes suggest El Greco. The infernal chaos of the climactic sequences are pure Hieronymus Bosch, updated for the age of Kristen Wiig and automatic weaponry.It falls to the actors to endow this highly symbolic, pictorially overloaded environment with a sense of human reality ¡ª with flesh and blood and feeling. Mr. Bardem, alpha male and omega man, is the kind of actor who can endow an abstraction with gravity and tenderness. (He did pretty much that in ¡°No Country for Old Men.¡±) The enigmatic nature of his character in ¡°Mother!¡± allows him to relax, to be playful and charismatic, and to disappear. Mr. Harris and especially Ms. Pfeiffer bring a jolt of shtick and a whisper of camp, qualities that you may miss terribly when they depart.Ms. Lawrence, for her part, bears an impossible burden. In dramatic terms, she is a passive, reactive protagonist, a cipher and, in the strict sense of the word, an icon. Called upon to embody all of womankind ¡ª and a lot else besides ¡ª she is denied the chance to be human, and her blankness empties the film of emotional power. What it has, instead, is extravagant sensation and churning intellectual energy. Mr. Aronofsky is a virtuoso of mood and timing, a devoted student of form and technique straining to be a credible visionary. But as wild and provocative as his images can be, there is something missing ¡ª an element of strangeness, of difficulty, of the kind of inspiration that overrides mere cleverness.On the other hand, ¡°Mother!¡± made me laugh harder and more frequently than just about any other movie I¡¯ve seen this year.

It is also, as the title suggests, about how things don¡¯t change, about the stubborn forces of custom, prejudice and power that lock people in place and impede social progress. Set mainly in the Mississippi Delta in the years just after World War II, when Jim Crow was still enshrined in law and practice, the film, directed by Dee Rees, tests and complicates William Faulkner¡¯s much-quoted claim about the not-even-pastness of the past. It¡¯s a work of historical imagination that lands in the present with disquieting, illuminating force.The particular corner of the past that Ms. Rees investigates is not entirely unfamiliar. The source of the screenplay for ¡°Mudbound¡± (which the director wrote with Virgil Williams) is a novel by Hillary Jordan that counts Faulkner and Toni Morrison among its evident literary influences. On film, the racial history of the American South tends to be flattened into reassuring morality tales in which black lives matter less than white consciences. Ms. Jordan¡¯s book occasionally wanders in the direction of this kind of soothing, redemptive storytelling ¡ª the white characters are split a bit too neatly into the righteous and the wicked, their black counterparts confined to salt-of-the-earth nobility ¡ª but the movie resists this tendency. Its people, members of two families knotted together by fate, hate and economics, are complicated. The wounds are raw.  What you notice first of all, though, is the land those people inhabit, a sometimes dusty, sometimes swampy area of broad fields and dirt roads that seems indifferent to human concerns. The cinematographer, Rachel Morrison, brings the soil, the flora and the weather to life in a way that emphasizes the archaic, elemental power of the story. Its modern implications are supplied by a cast of subtle actors and by Ms. Rees¡¯s knack for psychological nuance, an attentiveness to quiet moments and unstated emotions that animates her earlier films, the independent coming-of-age drama ¡°Pariah¡± and the HBO biopic ¡°Bessie.¡± ¡°Mudbound¡± provides her a larger canvas and a sprawling, crowded plot. Relying on multiple narrators to tell a tale (as Ms. Jordan does) is a common enough novelistic technique, but movies sometimes sag under the weight of even a single voice-over. The half-dozen voices who reflect on the meaning of the onscreen action might have been distracting or confusing, but instead, remarkably enough, they provide an almost musical structure and a feeling of moral gravity. What happens is a communal tragedy, but one that is experienced differently by everyone involved. The Jacksons are African-American tenant farmers who have managed, through years of toil, to arrive at a measure of stability and the guarded hope that something better might be possible in the future. The land they work is purchased by Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke), whose agriculture and business skills fall short of his ambitions. He and his wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), come to rely on Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige). Henry¡¯s feckless younger brother, Jamie (Garrett Hedlund), befriends the Jacksons¡¯ oldest son, Ronsel (Jason Mitchell). Both Ronsel and Jamie are combat veterans, and their natural camaraderie breaks the rules of racial separation, particularly infuriating Jamie and Henry¡¯s father, a hateful old cur they call Pappy (Jonathan Banks).Pappy¡¯s snarling, slur-spewing villainy verges on caricature, but ¡°Mudbound¡± does not pretend that his is the only, or even the most insidious, face of white supremacy. Nor does the film locate the poison of racism principally in the attitudes and feelings of the dominant race. What Hap and Florence are up against as they try to provide for their children and hold onto their dignity is a system of organized expropriation ¡ª a heritage of plunder (to borrow a term from the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates) designed to keep them poor, precarious and dependent. Their labor provides an insurance policy for Henry¡¯s bad luck and incompetence. Their successes will be punished so his failures can be mitigated and his entitlement upheld. What¡¯s theirs is his. The more sympathetic members of the McAllan clan ¡ª Laura, a bookish, musical, cultivated woman dragged into the mud by the blunt force of her husband¡¯s will, and Jamie, a dissolute, poetic soul of the kind Tennessee Williams would have recognized ¡ª are in some ways more dangerous to the Jacksons. Ronsel has seen enough of the world and tasted enough freedom to find the strictures of home intolerable. His insistence on behaving like a citizen already puts him at risk: After both world wars, black veterans were frequent targets of white violence. But Jamie, in his blithe disregard for local norms, is protected in a way Ronsel is not, and his refusal to grasp that asymmetry has terrible consequences.I won¡¯t spell those out. ¡°Mudbound¡± begins with the digging of a grave and then jumps backward in time to move slowly toward the shadow of at least one death. Along the way, quite a lot happens ¡ª a bit too much, perhaps. There are subplots that might have been excised and twists that are a little too contorted. But Ms. Rees also knows that plot is not everything, and she uses Ms. Jordan¡¯s busy narrative as a trellis rather than an engine. What happens is less important, finally, than who it is happening to.What stays with you are everyday moments ¡ª the wordless communication between Hap and Florence, the aimless soldiers¡¯ talk between Jamie and Ronsel, Laura¡¯s lonely patience, Henry¡¯s simmering insecurity ¡ª and the graceful performances that bring them to life. The way those instances of ordinary human tenderness and decency stand out is proof of the film¡¯s achievement, which is to lay bare a world in which cruelty is normal and injustice seems as implacable as the weather.",0.928520162619283,"Drama"

In my early teens I saw the then-grand movie adaptation, an all-star cast affair directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring Albert Finney as the finicky Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Christie¡¯s novel derives much of its notoriety from the solution to its mystery. It¡¯s very novel; whether it¡¯s ingenious or just ostentatious is still debated by mystery lovers. But even more than 40 years after Mr. Lumet¡¯s film I had presumed that the ending was so well-known that there would be little point in a remake. And yet, as the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins said in a different context, generations have trod, have trod, have trod, and there are plenty of millennials who haven¡¯t read the book. Mr. Finney¡¯s embodiment of Poirot in the Lumet picture was a marathon of sorts, with the actor testing how many of the beloved character¡¯s irritating yet endearing quirks could be pushed to the limits of coherence. In this latest version, Kenneth Branagh, who also directs (from a script by Michael Green), gives us a Poirot who¡¯s fussy but not too fussy, and rather crisp in his English-language diction. Most radically, this is a Poirot with heart. This interpretation is a dumb idea, but Mr. Branagh, an actor of prodigious skills, can at least pull this one half off. It¡¯s not the only dumb idea in this film, which nevertheless bounces along in a way that¡¯s sometimes almost entertaining.Mr. Branagh shot the film in the 65-millimeter format, which offers a particular kind of ¡°big movie¡± resolution. People tend to think that big-gauge celluloid is best for big-vista movies, such as ¡°Lawrence of Arabia,¡± but Mr. Branagh¡¯s picture is set almost entirely on a train. It is a very opulent train, and the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos gets all its ornate detail. It also gets the detail of the mostly C.G.I. special effects and settings, and here the marriage of digital and analog is awkward. In further pursuit of 65-millimeter shots, Mr. Branagh opens up the story regularly, however. He has the train stall on a cliff-side rail, supported by elaborate scaffolding on which he stages a foot chase. He has Poirot deliver his final summation of the case in a train tunnel. As in Mr. Lumet¡¯s adaptation, the supporting cast here is full of stars. Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Pen¨¦lope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, and newer faces like Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr., fill out the roster of subjects. Johnny Depp, who is known to make some eccentric choices in crafting his characters, does not (necessarily) disappoint in the role of the murder victim, Edward Ratchett. Imbuing that unsavory character with the dopiest of gangster mannerisms, Mr. Depp may remind you of Matt LeBlanc¡¯s ¡°Friends¡± character, Joey Tribbiani.

When a disturbed schoolmate cuts open his palm and drinks the blood, the others disperse, but Dahmer stands staring, transfixed.This film is sensitively wrought. It¡¯s credible in its evocation of mid-¡¯70s suburbia.

He spends his time flying a homemade kite from the window of an attic room decorated with his mother¡¯s empty beer cans. There are quite a few of those. Zucchini¡¯s father, whose likeness decorates the kite, is long gone, and an unfortunate accident soon removes Zucchini¡¯s mother from the picture.Zucchini, who is 9, is sent to a group home in the countryside, where he falls in with other abused, neglected and abandoned children. Perhaps because ¡°My Life as a Zucchini,¡± directed by Claude Barras and based on a book by Gilles Paris, comes from France (and Switzerland), the orphanage is a place of kindness rather than terror. The French republican imagination assumes that institutions are benevolent. Wickedness resides in individuals, in this case the parents whose failures and outright crimes have damaged the innocence of Zucchini and his new friends. Also, because ¡°My Life as a Zucchini¡± is an animated film ¡ª a loving work of stop-motion cartoon handicraft and a long-shot Oscar nominee ¡ª it is more charming than grim. The orphan at large in the world is a fixture of folklore and literature as well as social-service case files, and Mr. Barras¡¯s film, with its bigheaded, asymmetrical modeling-clay figures and off-kilter picture-book backdrops, explores a harsh situation with gentle whimsy. Still, a bit of caution may be in order for parents. While nothing shown onscreen is graphic or disturbing, the movie is frank about the way the characters have been treated and also about their natural curiosity regarding the adult world. Viewers who have read contemporary young-adult literature will be able to handle it, though their parents may feel uncomfortable at times. Children of Zucchini¡¯s age or younger might be freaked out.The point of the story, in any case, is not horror but healing.

The animation technique is in some ways cruder than the digital dazzle that kids see all the time, but also more soulful.

Trump, with three overarching points to make.The first is that whatever you think of Gawker¡¯s decision to publish an excerpt from a sex tape featuring Mr. Hogan, a professional wrestler whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, the case had potentially far-ranging implications for the news media¡¯s ability to cover public figures. The $140 million judgment against Gawker, which filed for bankruptcy and was later sold to Univision ¡ª the suit was ultimately settled with Mr. Hogan for $31 million ¡ª sets a precedent that the movie argues could snuff out significant reporting. (Not all legal experts are so sure.)The second is that the lawsuit itself, subsequently revealed to have been bankrolled by Peter Thiel, the PayPal founder and Silicon Valley billionaire, represented a disturbing instance of a powerful figure secretly using wealth to stifle a voice he regarded as adversarial. The movie suggests that while moguls meddling in the news is at least as old as William Randolph Hearst, hidden puppeteering of this sort is new. About an hour in, the movie clumsily shifts focus, introducing former staff members of The Las Vegas Review-Journal who recount Sheldon Adelson¡¯s secretive acquisition of that paper, a publication that could theoretically serve as a check on Mr. Adelson¡¯s dealings. The third, hardly a surprise, is that the presidency of Mr. Trump, who makes a regular target of reporters, represents a threat to news organizations interested in pursuing the truth.But just because ¡°Nobody Speak¡± has a timely message doesn¡¯t make it an ideal messenger. Mr. Knappenberger seems to have created this impassioned defense of news organizations for moviegoers who don¡¯t keep up with the news. Almost nothing in ¡°Nobody Speak¡± breaks new ground. As if afraid of boring anybody, Mr. Knappenberger lays on a percussive synthesizer score so insistent and manipulative that it¡¯s like watching the movie with electrodes attached.The featured interviewees include the parties involved, mostly with the Gawker side (the site¡¯s founder, Nick Denton, and Albert J. Daulerio, who wrote the post that accompanied the Hogan video, are heard from). Among the outside experts are the First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, who defended The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, and Margaret Sullivan, the Times¡¯s former public editor (now with The Washington Post). They frame the issues in reasonable sound bites, though Ms. Sullivan in particular has addressed the Gawker matter in more depth elsewhere.In that sense, perhaps the hacky presentation is strategic ¡ª a way of incentivizing viewers to click off Netflix and read the news instead.",0.111221251321409,"Documentary"
"301","Nocturama","2017-08-11","2017-08-10","http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/movies/nocturama-review-bertrand-bonello.html","",0,"¡°Nocturama¡± might be an interesting movie about terrorism if there were no such thing as terrorism. If, that is, politically motivated shootings and bombings in big cities were fantastical tropes or metaphorical conceits, like zombie epidemics or extraterrestrial invasions. But perhaps ¡°interesting¡± is too strong a word. Without a real-world correlative for the actions it depicts, Bertrand Bonello¡¯s new film would merely be tedious and pretentious rather than repellent.There is no denying that Mr. Bonello, whose previous films include ¡°House of Pleasures¡± (a prurient peek behind the scenes at an early-20th-century bordello) and ¡°Saint Laurent¡± (a salacious tour of ¡¯70s couture), possesses cinematic skill and suavity to spare. The story told in ¡°Nocturama¡± splits neatly into before and after, with a few flashbacks thrown in for clarity and variety. The first half follows a collection of young French people as they prepare to carry out a series of attacks in Paris; the second stays with them in the immediate aftermath, as they kill time in a high-end department store.Part 1 is fast-moving and suspenseful, Part 2 languorous and luxuriant. The young terrorists are brisk and businesslike until the plastic explosives detonate. Then they act out a parody of jaded consumerist hedonism, browsing among the brand names. Nike, Fendi, Issey Miyake ¡ª Mr. Bonello places the products so lovingly in the frame that you might think he was being paid to do it.Really, though, all he advertises is the vacuity of his imagination, which he mistakes for the moral emptiness of his characters and the society that spawned them. They are not ¡ª or not all ¡ª drawn from its margins or its oppressed groups. A few of the conspirators (there are eight in all, plus an inside man at the store) seem to be children of immigrants from suburban housing projects. The others come from France¡¯s middle and upper classes. One of the leaders is a student at an elite university, with family connections to the minister of the interior, whose office is among the group¡¯s targets. Other targets include the chief executive of a bank, a row of parked cars, a gilded equestrian statue and a skyscraper with the word ¡°global¡± conveniently displayed near its crown. The cause that motivates this violence is never specified. One member of the gang is a Muslim who doesn¡¯t drink alcohol and believes he will be welcomed in paradise as a martyr, but religious extremism doesn¡¯t seem to be part of the overall agenda. Nor does any recognizable political ideology or economic grievance. ¡°It was bound to happen,¡± a bored-sounding young woman says to a perpetrator who has wandered out for a cigarette.Her fatalism mirrors the nihilism behind the act, and also the chilly abstraction that characterizes Mr. Bonello¡¯s approach to a potentially volatile subject. As they try on fancy clothes and fiddle with wide-screen televisions and top-of-the-line sound equipment, the young rebels prove themselves to be perfect citizens of the system they supposedly hate. They don¡¯t really want to overthrow it or force it to change, but rather to make some noise, to feel as if they¡¯ve done something.An older generation of French radicals used to speak of the ¡°propaganda of the deed¡± ¡ª the idea that violent or disruptive action can function as a vehicle of political meaning. Today¡¯s terrorists are partly the inheritors of this notion, sending dramatic, lethal messages to enemies and sympathizers alike. For Mr. Bonello¡¯s cadre of good-looking militants, deeds are more like marketing slogans, expressions of a free-floating aesthetic of tedium and mild stimulation.He treats them with a mixture of solicitude and detachment that reveals its cruelty by degrees. The closer they come to their inevitable bloody end, the more human these mixed-up kids appear. We learn their names, and see evidence of tenderness and folly as well as steely heartlessness. They¡¯re so normal! But that revelation is really just confirmation of Mr. Bonello¡¯s shallow cynicism, his facile conviction that he has built a trap for the audience¡¯s conscience rather than a useless, self-consuming artifact. When the ruthless, faceless power of the state finally asserts itself, what is meant to be a shocking climax merits little more than a nod and a shrug. What took so long? There¡¯s nothing political about that response: Like ¡°Nocturama,¡± it¡¯s nothing but an expression of aesthetic ennui.",0.032669607747083,"Drama"

In his own mind, Norman Oppenheimer, a well-dressed, well-spoken Manhattanite played with feeling and mischief by Richard Gere, is what¡¯s known in Yiddish as a macher. He travels the circuits of money and influence, always just a few capillaries removed from the beating heart of power. His mental Rolodex swells with the names of the good and the great, every one of them ¡°a very close friend.¡± He¡¯d be happy to introduce you.His alleged friends ¡ª financiers, captains of industry, political big shots in Washington and Tel Aviv ¡ª might reckon things differently. A rising Israeli politician named Micha Eshel (Lior Ashkenazi) describes Norman to an aide as ¡°a warm Jew.¡± It¡¯s the nicest thing anyone can say. The aide, an actual fixer named Duby (Yehuda Almagor), has other ideas. In his eyes Norman is, at best, a minor annoyance; at worst, a threat to his patron¡¯s career. It¡¯s no accident that some of Duby¡¯s words about Norman ¡ª ¡°scheming¡± and ¡°bloodsucking,¡± in particular ¡ª evoke the historical language of anti-Semitism. Mr. Cedar, a New York-born Israeli filmmaker, has a sharp eye for intra-Jewish conflict, for the narcissism of large and small differences that can cause the unity of God¡¯s chosen people to splinter like matzo. His previous film, the sublime academic comedy ¡°Footnote,¡± mined father-son rivalry and scholarly antagonism for biblical pathos and borscht belt humor. ¡°Norman¡± traces fault lines, more cultural and temperamental than ideological or religious, between the members of the diaspora (or at least the New York wing of it) and their cousins in the Promised Land. One of Mr. Cedar¡¯s slyest conceptual jokes ¡ª and one of his boldest provocations at a moment of controversy about race and ethnicity in movie casting ¡ª is to place non-Jewish actors in most of the major American Jewish roles. (The Israelis are mostly Israeli, with the exception of Charlotte Gainsbourg, an ethereal embodiment of ethical seriousness and geographical nomadism.) In addition to Mr. Gere (who has never been better), there is Michael Sheen as Norman¡¯s nephew. Steve Buscemi plays a rabbi. It would be a pleasure to write that sentence even if the performance it designates were not a marvel of wit and off-kilter humanity.Which pretty much describes ¡°Norman¡± itself. It¡¯s only after the plot has unfolded, with antic elegance and brazen unpredictability, that the risks involved become apparent. The dangers are everywhere: overly broad humor; obnoxiously shticky performances; sentimental tribalism; easy moral point-scoring. None materialize. It¡¯s startling, given how much farce is on display ¡ª in the rise-and-fall structure of the narrative; in the madcap scenes of narrowly missed (or fully achieved) catastrophe; in the play of mistaken and forged identities ¡ª how much genuine feeling also comes through. It¡¯s less that Mr. Cedar blends realism with absurdity than that he refuses to acknowledge any distinction between them. Norman, who strides through Midtown in a tweed cap and a camel coat, connected to the world through the earbuds of his iPhone, is an utterly plausible denizen of a city on the move. He is also a nearly mythical figure, a creature sprung from the annals of Jewish literature. You will encounter his ilk ¡ª losers, strivers, hucksters and dreamers ¡ª in the novels of Saul Bellow and the stories of Franz Kafka and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Also in the films of Mel Brooks and the Coen Brothers. At one point, Norman meets his own double, in the shambolic person of Hank Azaria.Strictly speaking, Norman is a con artist, a spinner of exaggerations, half-truths and outright lies. This may be the source of Micha¡¯s affection for him: This future prime minister can produce his share of seductive rhetorical vapor, and the men also share an evident and endearing insecurity. They want to be liked, to matter not just in public affairs but to the people around them, too. And there is something almost selfless in Norman¡¯s hustle. He doesn¡¯t want wealth or power as much as he longs for proximity to them, for entree into a world where important things happen. He calls himself a businessman or a consultant, but he is really running a kind of social pyramid scheme, promising extravagant returns on small investments of kindness and courtesy.He almost succeeds. Or maybe ¡ª to give away as little as I can ¡ª he does succeed. Only at the very end, with thrilling subtlety and impressive clarity, does a fable blossom from the satirical earth. To put it another way: This is a rare Jewish joke in which the punch line lives up to the delivery.",0.993531610105516,"Drama"

And when he¡¯s handed a small video camera by his director and asked to film his life, the resulting diary of perseverance and suffering has a raw immediacy that¡¯s both appropriate and involving. The look is rough, the emotions always hovering near the surface.

As big as a medium-sized elephant, with a snout that looks more canine than porcine, she is slobbery and sometimes flatulent, but also loyal, gentle and brave. Okja is devoted, above all, to a girl named Mija. They have grown up together on a remote mountain farm that belongs to Mija¡¯s grandfather, inseparable companions in a classic literary and cinematic tradition.But anyone familiar with that tradition ¡ª I¡¯ll mention ¡°Old Yeller¡± and leave it at that ¡ª knows that stories of children and their pets are almost inevitably shadowed by tragedy and loss. The adult human world regards animals through a callous, utilitarian lens, as sources of food, labor or ornamental cuteness, a fact that ¡°Okja,¡± Bong Joon-ho¡¯s wonderful new film, takes to a dystopian but also an unnervingly realistic extreme.The bond between Okja and Mija, who is an orphan, is the result of a contract neither one of them has read or signed. The pig is the physical and intellectual property of a multinational corporation, and as such she¡¯s destined not only for the usual slaughter but also for crass and cynical commercial exploitation. The girl, a serious and stubborn child (played with heroic dignity by An Seo Hyun), is fated to lose her only friend. The audience already suspects as much. The first face we see belongs not to a cute computer-generated piglet but to Tilda Swinton, in braces and a blinding platinum bob. Her character, Lucy Mirando ¡ª chief executive of the Mirando Corporation, which she inherited from her father ¡ª steps in front of the camera to preside over the brightly greenwashed presentation of a diabolical initiative. A new superbreed of swine has been created, she says, and 26 shoats will be distributed to farmers around the world to be raised in sustainable, free-range conditions. After 10 years, they will participate in a kind of livestock beauty pageant, overseen by a popular television veterinarian played by an antic and abrasive Jake Gyllenhaal. The vet¡¯s arrival on Mija¡¯s granddad¡¯s farm, accompanied by Mirando suits and flacks (notably Yoon Jae moon and Shirley Henderson), signals the end of the film¡¯s pastoral interlude, a forest romp as lyrical and magical as anything by the great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Mr. Bong has an eye for natural beauty, and also a kinetic and rigorous sense of motion. Once it leaves the countryside, ¡°Okja¡± turns into a swift urban caper, full of chases and other action-movie set pieces. Mija sets out to liberate her beloved pig, and is joined (and also partly thwarted) by members of the Animal Liberation Front, an earnest, not-always-competent militant group led by Paul Dano.The pursuit of Okja jumps from Seoul to New York, and ends up at a nightmarish meat-processing plant in New Jersey. Mr. Bong, one of the great visual storytellers working in movies today ¡ª earlier films like ¡°The Host¡± and ¡°Snowpiercer¡± have shown him to be an artist of Spielbergian exuberance and skill ¡ª never muddies the frame with extraneous stuff or slows the narrative with tedious exposition. The picture, which never stops moving, is dense with information and feeling. Barbs of satire pop up and are washed away on streams of strong emotion. It¡¯s all marvelously preposterous and yet, at the same time, something important is at stake.A conventional name for that something would be humanity, since ¡°Okja,¡± not unlike ¡°E. T.,¡± is about how a young person achieves moral insight by connecting with and fighting for a nonhuman creature. Okja¡¯s oppressors, like E. T.¡¯s, are part of a system that refuses to recognize her as anything more than a thing. In this case, that system is specifically the food industrial complex, and her tale is a clear and effective animal rights fable, or at least a protest against factory farming and genetic engineering. (Nobody advocates for the fish and chickens Mija and her grandfather eat at home.) This might make the movie sound heavier and more dogmatic than it actually is. But if you have seen ¡°Snowpiercer,¡± a parable of global inequality set aboard a high-speed train, you know that Mr. Bong juggles delight and didacticism with exquisite grace. Rather than turn out cardboard heroes and villains, he savors the eccentricity of his characters, in the sheer weirdness of our ingenious and idiotic species. He is fascinated by the petty doctrinal arguments and personal rivalries in the ranks of the Animal Liberation Front and also by the boardroom intrigue within the Mirando Corporation. Keep your eye on Giancarlo Esposito, and your ear out for Lucy Mirando¡¯s sister, Nancy.The human performers are all brilliant, but the movie belongs to its title character and her digitally conjured, genetically modified ilk.

It begins not with a spark of passion but with a sensible, if unusual, proposal. Addie Moore shows up at Louis Waters¡¯s house and asks if he will sleep with her. Addie doesn¡¯t mean she wants to have sex with Louis. She wants to slide under the covers next to him, turn off the bedside lamp and chat quietly until slumber arrives, simulating the easy marital intimacy that the two of them, both long widowed, have learned to live without. Louis, startled by the idea, agrees to think about it.He and Addie are solid, respectable people of a kind who usually show up in movies to be mocked or sentimentalized. The disappointments and satisfactions they have lived through are etched on their faces, which are also the faces of two very famous movie stars ¡ª Jane Fonda and Robert Redford. Viewers with long memories or heavy TCM habits will recall that 50 years ago they starred as New York newlyweds in ¡°Barefoot in the Park.¡± In 1979, they reunited, with a touch more denim, in ¡°The Electric Horseman.¡± The intervening decades have hardly diminished their charm or their skill, and part of the pleasure of this film, directed by Ritesh Batra (¡°The Lunchbox¡±), lies in the rediscovery of what wonderful actors they can be, and how good they are together.¡°Our Souls at Night,¡± adapted (by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber) from Kent Haruf¡¯s final, posthumously published novel, is too cautious and cozy to be a great movie, or even a very interesting one. The music (by Elliot Goldenthal) telegraphs the emotions too precisely, and Mr. Haruf¡¯s wry and subtle plot is mishandled, so that there is both too much dramatic conflict and not quite enough. When Addie and Louis¡¯s grown-up children show up ¡ª played by Matthias Schoenaerts and Judy Greer ¡ª they drag in some bulky baggage. Each family has a painful event in its past, and each child represents a textbook drawing of the consequences of that pain, rather than a fully embodied, credibly suffering human being.Luckily, the stars have humanity to spare, and very little left to prove. With her careful diction and a bearing that conveys starchiness and sensuality in perfect, improbable balance, Ms. Fonda turns middle-class maturity into a bewitching form of charisma. Addie¡¯s approach to Louis, a man she has never known that well, is driven less by neediness than by a rational understanding of what she needs. She needs to be less alone. Louis, for his part, doesn¡¯t mind his solitude.

Their first, ¡°Lone Survivor¡± from 2013, chronicled an unsuccessful 2005 Navy SEAL mission to kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan. This year¡¯s ¡°Deepwater Horizon¡± was about a fatal 2010 disaster involving an oil rig collapse off the Louisiana coast. Now comes ¡°Patriots Day,¡± about the Boston Marathon bombing of April 15, 2013.Movies that depict heinous real-life criminal acts and attempt to grapple with their  human toll are provocative undertakings, particularly when they¡¯re made so soon after the actual events. As it happens, ¡°Patriots Day¡± works so well on a dramatic level that my qualms were silenced almost entirely from the start.The screenplay, which Mr. Berg wrote with Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer (Eric Johnson and Paul Tamasy contributed to the story), divides the movie into several story lines focusing on specific individuals. Although Mr. Wahlberg¡¯s character, a police detective who¡¯s working off a suspension by doing uniformed duty at the marathon, is a fictionalized composite, almost all of the other characters ¡ª from Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to the newlyweds played by Rachel Brosnahan and Christopher O¡¯Shea ¡ª are based on real people. Those also include the two bombers, the brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; Tamerlan¡¯s wife, Katherine Russell (Melissa Benoist); and Tamerlan and Katherine¡¯s toddler daughter, Zahira. Their little household is shown squabbling over milk for the baby on the morning of the bombing. This is about as humanizing as the depiction of the terrorists gets. Themo Melikidze¡¯s Tamerlan emerges as a terse and truculent quasi-fanatic, while Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff) is repellently trivial-minded in his sense of entitlement. When the brothers hijacked a terrified young man¡¯s S.U.V., which they are considering driving to New York to plant more bombs, Dzhokhar¡¯s almost immediate concern is whether it has an iPod dock. The movie¡¯s attitude toward Ms. Russell, who has not been accused or charged in connection with the bombings, is very aggressive, and her portrayal by Ms. Benoist is ice-cold and angry. (This is likely to prove controversial, most specifically with Ms. Russell¡¯s lawyers.)¡°Patriots Day¡± declines even to consider the jihadist ideology that apparently motivated the brothers ¡ª indeed, in an aside between F.B.I. agents and local law enforcement, it strongly suggests that Tamerlan¡¯s motivations were largely personal. Instead, the movie focuses on the community that the bombings intended to tear apart, and how Boston and its surrounding towns came together, imperfectly but with a steely determination, to apprehend the culprits.Shot and edited in a docudrama style that¡¯s a little less frenetic than is conventional, ¡°Patriots Day¡± is at its best as a vivid re-creation of the measures and resources needed to conduct investigations of such catastrophic crimes. The police get their backs up slightly when the F.B.I. team led by Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) shows up, and the film is frank in its depiction of what can fall through the cracks as well as what can be accomplished when multiple agencies try to collaborate.All the players here are good, but those in the roles of law enforcement parties ¡ª Mr. Wahlberg, Mr. Bacon, John Goodman, J. K. Simmons and Jake Picking among them ¡ª are particularly convincing. The movie also provides, especially in a firefight scene between the brothers and the police, a simultaneously bracing and dispiriting account of just how much havoc a pair of heavily armed moral weaklings can wreak when they are so determined. The film also has a longer-than-usual coda featuring interviews with the real figures fictionalized in the movie, which is commendable. My reservations about such pictures in general were not put to rest by ¡°Patriots Day,¡± but this film¡¯s real merits are not easily dismissed, either.",0.997749820248327,"Drama"

It¡¯s a universal religion, bringing the promise of grace and salvation into an otherwise drab existence. With a head full of bling-spangled reveries and a notebook full of rhymes, Patti (to use her most common nickname) hones her skills and indulges her dreams with her friend Hareesh (Siddharth Dhananjay), a pharmacist whose nom de mike is Jheri.¡°Patti Cake$,¡± Geremy Jasper¡¯s big-hearted and astute debut film ¡ª he wrote, directed and composed the songs that make Patti and Jheri¡¯s aspirations plausible ¡ª could have gone wrong in a dozen different ways. The story of a white suburban redhead chasing hip-hop glory may set off alarms about cultural appropriation, but the film mostly disarms them, or mixes them into the soundtrack. ¡°Why don¡¯t you act your age?¡± Patti asks her mother, Barb (Bridget Everett), an almost-was wannabe stuck in her own rock ¡¯n¡¯ roll fantasies. ¡°Why don¡¯t you act your race?¡± is Barb¡¯s barbed retort.Mother and daughter could easily have been figures of mockery. It¡¯s silly of Patti to imagine that she could be the next Nicki Minaj, and pathetic that Barb belts out old radio hits at karaoke. A lot of people in the movie make fun of the Dombrowski women, Patti in particular. Since middle school, she¡¯s been known as Dumbo, and when she enters into an impromptu rap battle with a guy who works at the local pizza place, his rhymes are full of fat-shaming and sexual humiliation. She gives back as good as she gets, and the film, rather than join in the ridicule, registers its cruelty.But we¡¯re not invited to feel sorry for her either. In structure and attitude, ¡°Patti Cake$¡± adheres to a template familiar to readers of young adult fiction, blending realism with gentle but unmistakable messages of encouragement. It tells the story of a band of young misfits asserting themselves in a world that refuses to see their value. Jheri and Patti find a beat wizard (and Patti finds a romantic interest) in the person of a taciturn African-American punk rocker (Mamoudou Athie) who lives in a shack near the cemetery and goes by the name of Basterd. The three of them, now called PBNJ, start cutting tracks and planning their assault on the big time. It¡¯s impossible not to root for them. The older generation comes in for harsher treatment. Wayward parents are a staple of the genre, and Barb wouldn¡¯t place high in a mother-of-the-year contest, but Ms. Everett, a popular cabaret performer and a brilliant actress, endows her with dignity even at her worst. Patti¡¯s grandmother (Cathy Moriarty) gives her more support and earns more sympathy, and also serves as a kind of guarantor of her granddaughter¡¯s decency and ultimate safety. There will be tears, embarrassment and disappointment, but we¡¯re not here to be miserable.And Ms. Macdonald is quite simply a revelation, capturing the reflexive self-confidence and defensive diffidence of the millennial generation with sneaky sincerity and offhand wit. Though it is expressively shot and crisply edited, the credibility of ¡°Patti Cake$¡± ultimately rests on her shoulders. We have to believe that Patti is talented, and also that the odds are not in her favor. ¡°It¡¯s a cold world out there,¡± she¡¯s told by her favorite D.J. (played by MC Lyte), and for us to savor the sweetness of Patti¡¯s creativity we need to feel that chill.Mr. Jasper at once finds a new variation on a central hip-hop theme and gives a hip-hop inflection to a durable show-business-movie convention. As long as there are underdogs and misunderstood kids fighting to be noticed (and paid), there will be stories like this one, walking the line between clich¨¦ and classic with grit, conviction and just enough cynicism to keep things from getting too corny.",0.278970544386384,"Drama"

Mr. Assayas¡¯s world is populated by figures in perpetual transit: actors, corporate executives, terrorists. Their identities have been dissolved by perpetual displacement. We remember their faces (which are often the faces of movie stars), even if we¡¯re not quite sure who they are.Maureen, who works as a personal shopper for a spoiled celebrity named Kyra, certainly brushes up against glamour, and occasionally tries on a piece of Kyra¡¯s borrowed couture. But she dwells mostly in a benumbed, stressed-out limbo, in frenzied motion from one nowhere to the next. Her human connections are often mediated by screens. She video-chats with her boyfriend, a tech consultant on assignment in Oman. She exchanges feverish texts with a stranger on a train from Paris to London and back. When asked what she¡¯s doing in Paris, Maureen answers, ¡°I¡¯m waiting.¡±What she¡¯s waiting for is a sign from her twin brother, Lewis, whose recent death partly explains his sister¡¯s dazed, blunted affect. If ¡°Personal Shopper,¡± Mr. Assayas¡¯s new movie, is a supernatural thriller and an unnerving inquiry into the drift and mystery of modern life, it is also a raw and smoldering study in grief. Kristen Stewart, who plays Maureen, has something in common with other stars of Mr. Assayas¡¯s films, notably Maggie Cheung in ¡°Irma Vep¡± and ¡°Clean¡± ¡ª a quality of self-enclosed detachment that becomes its own peculiar form of intensity.

In ¡°Clouds of Sils Maria,¡± Mr. Assayas¡¯s previous film, Ms. Stewart¡¯s character, another celebrity assistant, did vanish. You might say she ghosted.

Mark Bridges designed the costumes. Mr. Anderson served as his own director of photography.) The result of this collective toil is a singular vessel for beauty and pleasure, subject to the whims of the market and the vagaries of taste and therefore easy to trivialize. It¡¯s just a movie. It¡¯s just a dress. When Reynolds¡¯s sister and business partner, Cyril (Lesley Manville), informs him of the departure of a longtime client for a house she regards as more ¡°chic,¡± the designer has a small tantrum. The word disgusts him, not least because it expresses the vulgarity of the environment in which he must pursue his lofty visions. That discrepancy ¡ª between an exquisite sensibility and a world of grubby, shallow materialism ¡ª may explain some of the temperamental quirks that Reynolds shares with his creator. Over the years, especially since ¡°There Will Be Blood,¡± Mr. Anderson has repeatedly manifested his indifference to the fashions and conventions of contemporary filmmaking. In particular, he disdains the careful, self-conscious husbanding of themes and messages that preoccupies many of his peers. He always seems more interested in what his movies are than in what they¡¯re about or who they might be for.¡°Phantom Thread¡± is not as hermetic as ¡°The Master¡± or as loosey-goosey as ¡°Inherent Vice.¡± It¡¯s a chamber piece, romantic and baroque in equal measure, with arresting harmonies and ravishing changes of tone. (This might be the place to note that Jonny Greenwood composed the score). Like ¡°There Will Be Blood,¡± it casts Mr. Day-Lewis as an avatar of obsession, driven this time by the pursuit of aesthetic perfection rather than money and power. But whereas Daniel Plainview in the earlier film was a vector of pure, demonic ambition, Reynolds Woodcock bemusedly discovers himself to be one leg of a complicated emotional triangle.The other sides are Cyril and Alma (Vicky Krieps), a non-British waitress in a provincial British restaurant who becomes Reynolds¡¯s model, mistress and muse. Usually this is a temporary assignment. We briefly meet Alma¡¯s predecessor, Johanna (Camilla Rutherford), who annoys Reynolds at breakfast and is dismissed offscreen by Cyril, with one of Reynolds¡¯s old dresses as a consolation prize. Johanna¡¯s sin is to request some of her lover¡¯s attention, a demand he regards as intrusive and distracting.That dynamic will repeat itself with Alma, who butters her toast too noisily, pours tea with too much splashing and boldly asserts her right to exist as something more than an ornament in the Woodcock household. The battle of wills that ensues ¡ª a two-front war for Alma, who must contend with both Woodcock siblings ¡ª is the film¡¯s dramatic furnace and its comic engine. The three main performances are each as richly textured and subtly shaded as the clothes. Mr. Day-Lewis composes a symphony of moods: sardonic, melancholy, inspired, impatient. But he is matched by Ms. Krieps, an actress from Luxembourg as canny and unintimidated as Alma herself. Is this collaboration or competition? A tango or a tennis match? Whatever it is, this partnership is thrilling to watch: funny, wrenching, full of large and small surprises. The difference between melodrama and comedy is a matter of perspective. Alma, Cyril and Reynolds are all, in their various ways, supremely witty people, capable of underlining the absurdity of their situations with a well-arched eyebrow or a devastating remark. They are acutely sensitive as well. What is painful to them is sometimes funny to us. The reverse is also true.Like a garment that can be worn with the lining on the outside, ¡°Phantom Thread¡± reverses itself, almost imperceptibly flipping from Reynolds¡¯s point of view to Alma¡¯s and back again. She succumbs, at first, to what is most likely a well-practiced campaign of seduction: Reynolds flirts with her at breakfast, invites her to dinner, takes her back to his country house and sets about making her a dress. What she regards as her physical flaws ¡ª small breasts, broad shoulders, wide hips ¡ª he sees as signs of perfection. She is dazzled by his ability to be dazzled by her.But then, when the spell seems about to wear off, Alma refuses to let it. She rejects the shabby bargain Reynolds offers her, which demands the complete suppression of her will in exchange for his occasional recognition of her existence. ¡°I live here,¡± she says to a client who might otherwise have assumed she was just another seamstress. She fights for her position in the household, trying to outmaneuver Cyril and to force Reynolds to recognize her as his equal. There is some temerity in this, and some novelty in the way Mr. Anderson depicts their relationship. The wives of artists in movies and literature tend to be doormats or helpmeets, and their psychic anguish and creative fire rarely move from background to center stage.Is Alma a feminist heroine? Some version of that question is likely to fuel more than a few post-screening arguments. Your answer may depend on what you think of the mushroom omelet that is the movie¡¯s spoiler-proof surprise. There are other things to talk about. On first viewing, the captivating strangeness of the mood and the elegant threading of the plot are likely to hold your attention, but later you can go back to savor the lustrous colors, the fine-grained performances and the romantic mystery that holds the whole thing together.What kind of love story is ¡°Phantom Thread¡±? The wrenching tale of a woman¡¯s love for a man and a man¡¯s love for his work. A dry, comic study of the asymmetries and conflicts at the heart of a marriage. A refined gothic nightmare in the manner of Henry James. A perverse psychological fable of unchecked ego and unhinged desire. That¡¯s a partial catalog, and one that can¡¯t quite capture how bizarre this movie is. Or how bizarrely true to life ¡ª to art, to love, to itself ¡ª it feels.",0.946078898717697,"Drama"

The movie under consideration ¡ª ¡°Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales¡± ¡ª is, by contrasts, long and punishing. Its pleasures are so meager, its delight in its own inventions so forced and false, that it becomes almost the perfect opposite of entertainment. To insist otherwise is a variation on the sunk cost fallacy. Since you exchanged money for fun, fun is surely what you must have purchased, and you may cling to that idea in the face of contrary evidence. But trust me on this: This movie would be a rip-off even if someone paid you to see it.Because, to be honest, it¡¯s barely a movie at all. The first installments of the ¡°Pirates¡± franchise conquered skepticism with exuberance and charm. Somehow, a theme-park ride combined with clever, madcap visuals and Johnny Depp¡¯s scapegrace showboating added up to something fresh. But that spirit is long gone. Mr. Depp, as Capt. Jack Sparrow, goes through the motions like a washed-up rock star reprising his greatest hits in a half-empty auditorium.

That¡¯s especially true when you consider the real origin of Wonder Woman, the warrior with the indestructible bracelets and slightly kinky magic lasso who burst into comics in 1941. As it happens, there was more kink to her story than suggested by that golden lasso, which she uses to force her captives to tell the truth and looks like something from a bondage emporium. ¡°On Paradise Island where we play many binding games,¡± she says in an early comic while roping another woman, ¡°this is considered the safest method of tying a girl¡¯s arms!¡±There are some exceedingly delectable questions posed in ¡°Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,¡± and a few frisky binding games on tap too. A sly and thoroughly charming Trojan horse of a movie, ¡°Professor Marston¡± tells the story of the man who created Wonder Woman and the women who inspired him, both in and out of bed. The movie gleams and has all the smooth surfaces and persuasive detail of a typical period picture ¡ª the fedoras, the rides, the Katharine Hepburn trousers. All that luster, which too often in movies suggests polite manners and drowsily safe entertainment, proves to be a seductive, glossy way into something more satisfyingly complicated.If nothing else, ¡°Professor Marston¡± is another reminder that once upon a time people had sexual appetites and relationships as complex as those of today (or of 18th-century France), something else the movies don¡¯t always like to admit. Occasionally, grandpa might have even visited a dusty, mysterious shop with sexy specialty items in front and something naughtier in back. Dr. William Moulton Marston (a winning Luke Evans) finds out just how special those items could be when he pops into a store where a man calling himself the G-string King (J.J. Feild) opens up a world of consensual power play and pleasure.At that point, life has already become interesting for Marston. The writer-director Angela Robinson lays out just how, well, knotty it all is with wit, sympathy and economy. Spanning decades, the story takes flight in 1928 with Marston teaching young lovelies at Radcliffe. ¡°Are you normal?¡± he asks of a beaming, receptive audience that serves as an amusing stand-in for the viewer. Marston has answers to that and other questions, along with a theory he calls DISC ¡ª for dominance, inducement, submission and compliance ¡ª which sounds terribly complex and slightly ridiculous. (¡°D, I, S and C,¡± the real Marston wrote, ¡°represent nodal points in the integrative emotion series.¡±) Ms. Robinson borrows Marston¡¯s theory, using it as a clever if somewhat schematic framing device as she spins her story. There are moments of domination, psychological as well as physical. There are also interludes of inducement, submission and compliance mixed in with a sweet, soft-focus romance that initially involves Marston and his wife, a frustrated academic, Elizabeth Holloway Marston (Rebecca Hall, tart, brisk, essential), and soon includes a third, Olive Byrne (a very good Bella Heathcote). A student, Olive cracks open the Marstons¡¯ marriage, but instead of destroying it helps it grow into a shared, liberating adventure that settles into something cozily domestic.The story of the world¡¯s most famous female superhero, her creators and inspirers, has been told elsewhere, including in Jill Lepore¡¯s book ¡°The Secret History of Wonder Woman.¡± Ms. Robinson draws on archival sources for her telling and takes some liberties with the historical record, shuffling events around to dovetail with the polymorphous possibilities she¡¯s most interested in. The movie recurrently returns to the 1940s with Marston being grilled by a comic-book skeptic (Connie Britton) about his creation, scenes that fill in some details but also interrupt the fluid narrative flow. These sequences read as a stand-in for the 1950s anti-comic-book crusade of Dr. Fredric Wertham, who condemned Wonder Woman as a ¡°cruel, ¡®phallic¡¯ woman.¡±Dr. Wertham saw cruelty in the Wonder Woman world, but Ms. Robinson sees deep, enduring love in its back story as well as freedom, including from rigid gender roles. Her version of the idealistic professor and his two wonder women, and the complex geometry that defined their relationship, may be a touch fuzzier than the actual story. Certainly the real Marston didn¡¯t have Mr. Evans¡¯s sleek matinee-idol looks. But it¡¯s a pleasurable fantasy, as well as a gentle, appealingly Utopian vision of a world in which men and women can slip from their traditional binds into new, excitingly freeing configurations. Those might be surprising, perhaps even a bit tight around the wrists but, as Ms. Robinson suggests, there are so many possibilities when you¡¯re given room to play.The real Marston was delightfully unbound. In 1937, Ms. Lepore writes in her book, he held a news conference to announce the coming Amazonian rule. The Washington Post ran with the story: ¡°Neglected Amazons to Rule Men in 1,000 Yrs., Says Psychologist.¡± The Los Angeles Times went with the punchier ¡°Feminine Rule Declared Fact.¡± ¡°The next 100 years will see the beginning of an American matriarchy,¡± Mr. Marston said (2037 here we come!).

Its power lies in its attention to the drama of everyday existence, and Mr. Olshefski¡¯s sharp eye for character. We track PJ¡¯s adolescent moods, the tenderness and occasional tension that defines her parents¡¯ relationship, and also the ups and downs of other friends and kin. Ms. Rainey¡¯s older son, William, begins treatment for brain cancer as he¡¯s about to become a father.

The cinematography isn¡¯t the greatest, and the structure is hit or miss, but so what? In a movie this good natured, the heart is everything.The performances are hilarious, but the dancing is no joke. As Gia Kourlas, a dance critic for The New York Times, points out, it takes exceptionally strong technique to merge classical choreography and comedy. Achieving what James Whiteside, a principal dancer for American Ballet Theater, calls ¡°a balance between high art and clever camp¡± requires endless rehearsal and often physical therapy. Hoisting a 150-lb. man aloft is not for the weak-kneed.Born from the dust of the Stonewall riots in the 1970s (the name is a homage to the legendary Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo), the company was initially blackballed by financiers and quickly learned to survive on a budget. Leading us lightly through that history, the artistic director and the movie¡¯s unofficial narrator, Tory Dobrin, describes the devastation of AIDS and the relief of creating a space where dancers could forge their own identities. Giving the middle finger to classical ballet was just gravy.Filming for four years, Ms. Hart follows a handful of touching individual stories and takes us on the road (the Trocks, as they are known, are rock stars in Japan), a punishing travel schedule that gobbles up more than two-thirds of the year.

Dance is her life.

Following her as she begins to reinvent herself as a dancer outside of ballet, the film is both a comeback story and, more profoundly, a coming to terms with aging.¡°Restless Creature¡± is tightly edited but patient, with as many uneventful scenes of physical therapy and cocktail parties as more dramatic footage of surgery and is-she-pushing-too-hard suspense. Ballet dancers are experts in masking pain.

Ms. Whelan, who escaped injury for most of her career, says that she has lived her whole life in ¡°a fantasy world,¡± believing she would never break.

By the end, it¡¯s easy to understand the judgment of a colleague that this anti-diva changed the profession.The plentiful snippets of Ms. Whelan dancing signature roles give a cumulative sense of her gifts. Though a dance fan could wish for more sustained sequences, what comes across is less a performance than a person the viewer has come to know, dancing with people she loves in choreography made for her by friends (who may happen to be Christopher Wheeldon and Alexei Ratmansky). ¡°Restless Creature¡± humanizes dance.More remarkable, though, is how the film and Ms. Whelan, without falsification, turn an extreme form of midlife crisis into a heartening tale. ¡°Restless Creature¡± makes the potential compensations of age seem as beautiful as any ballet.",0.964747297305419,"Documentary"

Remember social media before the trolls and fake-news hucksters took it over? ¡°Risk¡± will take you back, briefly, to that era. It is possible to imagine circumstances ¡ª a different result in the 2016 presidential election, say, but not only that ¡ª in which this movie would be a more or less straightforward prequel to ¡°Citizenfour,¡± Ms. Poitras¡¯s Oscar-winning documentary about Edward J. Snowden. That film is in a sense tucked inside ¡°Risk,¡± as Ms. Poitras abruptly leaves London, where she met with Mr. Assange, for Hong Kong, summoned by a message from an anonymous whistle-blower who will turn out to be Mr. Snowden. She sees less of Mr. Assange after that, and you get the impression that he was not altogether pleased with the shift in the filmmaker¡¯s (and the rest of the world¡¯s) attention away from him.It would be simplistic to describe ¡°Risk¡± as the chronicle of Ms. Poitras¡¯s disillusionment with Mr. Assange. She is a discreet and careful observer, inserting herself into the story only when it might seem evasive to do otherwise and refraining from passing judgment on Mr. Assange. But any interesting portrait is necessarily the record of a relationship between artist and subject, each of whom is invested in controlling the outcome. And to some degree in spite of Ms. Poitras¡¯s journalistic intentions ¡ª though very much as a consequence of her rigorous honesty ¡ª the picture that emerges is complicated, unsettling and intriguingly ambivalent.¡°Why does he trust me?¡± Ms. Poitras asks in one of the voice-over diary entries that punctuate ¡°Risk.¡± ¡°I don¡¯t think he likes me.¡± That is hard for the viewer to judge, since the filmmaker doesn¡¯t appear on camera and her subject does not exactly exude warmth. But the trust is evident in his candor and in the remarkable access she was granted, both in the estate in Norfolk, England, where Mr. Assange was confined during his period of house arrest and in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he sought asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden.With weary impatience, Mr. Assange describes the sexual assault allegations against him as the product of a feminist conspiracy. ¡°Risk¡± takes them seriously, and sheds light on the ugly thread of misogyny and predation that runs through so much of the tech world ¡ª in Silicon Valley executive suites as well as in gamer message boards and hacker collectives ¡ª and that has been dismissed or denied for far too long.The movie also examines ¡ª not always explicitly, and not entirely by design ¡ª the workings of a contemporary personality cult. Mr. Assange, who muses on his ¡°god complex¡± and his capacity for martyrdom, likes to surround himself with disciples. Fidelity to the message melts into loyalty to the messenger, even if the message itself can sound a bit blurry. In one interview, Mr. Assange explains the need to balance principles and pragmatism, and in another he speaks of the necessity of a global outlook in trying to change the world. But he demurs when asked about the changes he would like to see come about, and never arrives at a clear articulation of principle. He insists on transparency while choosing to remain opaque. It is appropriate, though not entirely satisfying, that ¡°Risk¡± ends in a swirl of confusion. Events since Cannes have upended many of the arguments that the film might have clarified. The pressing empirical questions about Mr. Assange now have to do with the extent and nature of his intervention in the election. Those questions ¡ª about Russia, the F.B.I. and members of the Trump campaign ¡ª can¡¯t yet be answered by a movie, much less a movie review. And the deeper historical and ideological questions that the film poses will also take a long time to work out.The one that haunted me most goes something like this: What if some of the organizations and individuals that seemed, not so long ago, to be pushing liberal democracy to live up to its potential were actually contributing to its demise?",0.969013671184787,"Documentary"

So there is a sense in which ¡°Roman J. Israel, Esq.,¡± a wildly idiosyncratic drama about a wildly idiosyncratic lawyer, deserves not only critical leniency, but also maybe your investment.Yet this film doesn¡¯t do the cause many favors. It certainly doesn¡¯t serve Denzel Washington, in a role unlike any he has played that nevertheless saddles him with a collection of tics meant to compensate for the underrealized complexity of the part. And it offers tonal whiplash for viewers, with several potentially great ideas that don¡¯t settle into a coherent whole. The movie starts in the vein of a ruthlessly intelligent drama like ¡°Michael Clayton¡± before racing through adversity, running a couple of unearned victory laps and landing just shy of a mawkish Will Smith vehicle like ¡°Seven Pounds.¡±The film was written and directed by Dan Gilroy, whose ¡°Nightcrawler¡± centered on Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a monomaniacal cameraman whose lack of a moral compass allowed him to succeed in local television news. Roman Israel (Mr. Washington) is equally single-minded in his pursuits, but otherwise he¡¯s Lou¡¯s opposite: a hapless striver whose compulsions interfere with his ambitions.Roman keeps to his office in a small Los Angeles firm. He is a whiz with briefs and apparently knows the legal code by number, but his partner is always the one who appears in court, having more tolerance for what Roman calls the ¡°butchery¡± of plea deals and excessive sentences. When the partner has a heart attack, Roman, who can¡¯t run the firm alone or stop himself from talking back to a judge, eventually takes a job with George Pierce (Colin Farrell), a high-flying lawyer who doesn¡¯t necessarily share Roman¡¯s ideals. A veteran social reformer with a dated hairstyle and glasses that only exaggerate his awkwardness, Roman is almost certainly somewhere on the autism spectrum. In a performance that¡¯s meant to grate, Mr. Washington highlights the character¡¯s difficulty making eye contact and his habit of laughing and smiling with too much emphasis. As intriguing as it is to watch a movie about someone who is gifted yet hamstrung by his own mind, you do wonder whether ¡ª after Roman and Lou ¡ª Mr. Gilroy is capable of writing protagonists who aren¡¯t so affectedly at odds with their environments.The fish-out-of-water clash at the firm is absorbing enough, but the movie misfires when it appoints Roman as a sort of an angelic figure (or, as his last name may signal, a prophet). Carmen Ejogo appears as a younger civil rights advocate who, unlike the other activists we meet from her generation, recognizes Roman¡¯s past contributions and explains that she feels privileged to know him. Roman even begins to grow on George, who inexplicably warms to him just as Roman is wreaking havoc at the firm. And when Roman makes not one but two symbolic getaways ¡ª one to Santa Monica, one to the desert ¡ª ¡°Roman J. Israel, Esq.¡± seems like a movie that has no idea where it¡¯s heading.While ¡°Nightcrawler¡± delivered its bludgeoning lecture on TV sensationalism about four decades too late, ¡°Roman J. Israel, Esq.¡± goes oddly easy on the cruel bureaucracy of the legal system. Either Roman is too pure for the world of this movie or he is not.

That¡¯s the question in the soft vanilla comedy ¡°Rough Night,¡± about five women who blunder into disaster over the course of a carousing bachelorette weekend. If you¡¯ve seen ¡°The Hangover¡± and its sequels or various other movies of this familiar ilk, you have more or less seen ¡°Rough Night.¡± There¡¯s even a movie titled ¡°Bachelorette,¡± another would-be laugh-in about friends who go crazy ¡ª snort, snort, snort, chug, chug ¡ª until they¡¯re put back on the path toward happily ever after.In ¡°Rough Night,¡± Scarlett Johansson stars as Jess and is nearly eclipsed by Kate McKinnon, who plays one of her pals. A politician who¡¯s about to get married, Jess is on the verge of losing a state senate race to an opponent who has pulled ahead with some Anthony Weiner-esque penis pictures. That a competent female politician can¡¯t compete with literal penises suggests that the filmmakers have some ideas in store, something, say, that mines the comedy of our new Neanderthalism, an age partly defined by the reinvigorated war between the sexes and the triumphant rise and occasional fall of male members.No such luck. The director Lucia Aniello, who wrote the script with Paul W. Downs, soon abandons any pretense that she is going to deliver more than goofs. Instead, she trots out clich¨¦s, including a flashback that shows Jess and another bestie, Alice (Jillian Bell), holding their own at a frat blowout. Here, partying hard is meant as a stand-in for equality, which is mighty low stakes on which to build a gender-flipping comedy. Nonetheless, Ms. Aniello barrels ahead with limp penis jokes, yuks and a little upchuck, throwing in a starry guest appearance and the requisite slow-motion wolf-pack shot of the women strolling in a line, an image so stale it¡¯s an entry on tvtropes.org.It¡¯s all blithely formulaic and would be more irritating if the performers ¡ª who include Zo<U+00EB> Kravitz and Ilana Glazer ¡ª weren¡¯t generally so appealing. (Ms. Glazer is a star of the Comedy Central show ¡°Broad City,¡± which Ms. Aniello and Mr. Downs also both work on.) The actors are playing types, not people, but most bring enough natural presence and good will to fill in their characters¡¯ sketchy profiles. It helps, too, that Ms. Johansson and Ms. Glazer are gifted physical performers who can sell weak jokes, though no one steals a show like Ms. McKinnon, a brilliantly versatile comic who reaches Madeline Kahn-levels of eyeball-rolling, eyeball-popping and all-knowing dementedness. Those eyes get a workout when the women¡¯s weekend takes a detour that¡¯s straight out of ¡°Very Bad Things,¡± a 1998 comedy about a bachelor party that turns deadly when a reveler accidentally kills a female prostitute. In response, the men embrace their worst instincts, which in this case means they hide one death and, in the process, instigate another. Boys will be boys and sometimes killers ¡ª or so ¡°Very Bad Things¡± cheerfully suggests. ¡°The Hangover¡± basically packages such rotten male behavior for the mainstream, using a live hooker instead of a dead one and adding Mike Tyson, an errant tiger and a pileup of belabored high jinks. Women scarcely figure in its manly meltdown, which is the point.¡°Rough Night¡± switches the gender lineup from ¡°Very Bad Things¡± but with less (shallow) philosophizing and heterosexual panic. Much like their ¡°Very Bad¡± counterparts, the women quickly embrace self-interest, which leads to unfunny gags with an inconvenient corpse. That women can be as deadly or immoral as men isn¡¯t new or interesting, and here it also isn¡¯t all that entertaining. What is notable is that ¡°Rough Night¡± makes room for the opposite sex (too many comedies are his or hers), specifically with some slow-building nonsense involving Jess¡¯s fianc¨¦ (Mr. Downs), who crashes the party in adult diapers ¡ª which reads as a nice, sly wink at the comedy of male infantilism.American comedy has long depended on overgrown baby boys ¡ª Lou Costello, Will Ferrell ¡ª whose na<U+00EF>vet¨¦, entertaining misbehavior or outright stupidity suggests that men are finally as toothless as infants. It¡¯s a convenient fantasy (don¡¯t worry, ladies!), one that has grown less viable as women have gained power and autonomy offscreen. ¡°Rough Night¡± wants its female characters to get down, dirty and dumb, too, and indulge in their ostensible vices as unapologetically as any Zach Galifianakis boob.

It tells of a Portuguese Jesuit priest, Father Rodrigues, who in 1643 heads into the dark heart of Japan, where Christians are being persecuted ¡ª boiled alive, immolated and crucified. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) sets out to help keep the church alive in Japan, a mission that perhaps inevitably leads to God. The film¡¯s solemnity is seductive ¡ª as is Mr. Scorsese¡¯s art ¡ª especially in light of the triviality and primitiveness of many movies, even if its moments of greatness also make its failures seem more pronounced.Mr. Scorsese¡¯s work has long involved struggles of faith of one kind or another, from the religious guilt that afflicts Harvey Keitel¡¯s thug in ¡°Mean Streets¡± (¡°You don¡¯t make up for your sins in the church.¡±) through that circle of hell known as ¡°The Wolf of Wall Street.¡± In ¡°Silence¡± the struggle begins in a mist-wreathed landscape where severed human heads rest on a crude shelf, like trophies of some ghastly victory. Today, decapitations in the name of religion are a gruesome hallmark of Islamist extremists, but here they introduce a dispute involving the Japanese authorities, who, intent on maintaining the country¡¯s power and isolation, are set on eradicating Christianity, its proselytizers and converts.Figures soon emerge from the mist, notably Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who, as gaunt and tormented as any martyred Caravaggio saint, watches in gaping horror as guards ladle water from hot springs on shrieking Christians. Rodrigues learns about this hellish scene from Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds), who also relates that Ferreira has renounced his religion and is living as ¡°a Japanese.¡± Rodrigues, having studied with Ferreira, refuses to accept that the older priest¡¯s belief has been shattered and departs for Japan accompanied by another priest, Father Garupe (a fine, underused Adam Driver), and a Japanese guide, Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka, excellent).The movie¡¯s early scenes are filled with severe pictorial beauty as the pale thermal steam snaking around the martyred Christians gives way to the vaulted white room where the black-clothed Jesuits meet. The chromatic contrast between the inkiness of their cassocks and the room¡¯s ascetic whiteness finds an echo in Rodrigues¡¯s rigid dualism, a belief in absolutes that will be tested. His resoluteness even seems answered by the calm camerawork (no jitters here), which early on is dramatically punctuated by a ravishing overhead shot of the three Jesuit priests gliding down a flight of stony, bleach-white stairs, as if they were being looked down on from high above. Whether this represents God¡¯s vision or that of the priests, it is very much the point of view of the movie¡¯s own creator. This overhead shot and others suggest that there¡¯s a divine aspect to the priests¡¯ mission, an idea that Mr. Scorsese visually and narratively underlines in the Lazarus-like cave in which Rodrigues and Garupe first take shelter in Japan; in Rodrigues¡¯s self-aggrandizing identification with Jesus; and, crucially, through the figure of Judas. As in Mr. Scorsese¡¯s 1988 film, ¡°The Last Temptation of Christ,¡± his messy, excitingly alive adaptation of that Nikos Kazantzakis novel, Judas must play a part in ¡°Silence¡± because without him there can be no Jesus.Once in Japan, Rodrigues and Garupe make contact with a village of hidden Christians, who live in fear of the authorities and a cobralike smiler known as the Inquisitor, Inoue (Issey Ogata, in one of the film¡¯s strongest performances). By day, the priests hide in a small, cramped hut near the village; by night, they lead their new flock in dimly lighted rooms, delivering sermons in Latin, baptizing children and taking confession. Mr. Scorsese draws some modest, uneasy comedy from the linguistic and cultural differences between the priests and their congregation, as when a grabby, highly agitated woman begs the rather startled Garupe to hear her confession.Despite the mugging from both confessor and confessed, the exchange feels forced and comes across as a bid to lighten the gloom; if anything, it turns a feverish plea for absolution into a bit of vaudeville. There¡¯s something uncomfortably and literally childlike about this child of God, who, like the other villagers, with their pleading eyes and hands, seems like a relic from a white-savior myth. Kichijiro, who enters grunting and twitching, as if in homage to Toshiro Mifune, and grovels at the priest¡¯s feet, also seems on hand as much for comic relief as for guidance. Yet, even as the film seems to share the outsider perspectives of Rodrigues and Garupe, instructively, it is the village elders ¡ª brilliantly played by Yoshi Oida and Shinya Tsukamoto ¡ª who give these scenes flesh, bone and pain.¡°Silence¡± is based on the 1966 novel by the Japanese author Shusaku Endo that has attracted heavyweight admirers since it was first published. Graham Greene praised the novel, as did John Updike; for years, Mr. Scorsese tried to turn it into a film. (He wrote the foreword for a recent edition.) Filled with reams of religious dialogue, the novel fictionalizes history ¡ª the 17th-century purging of Christianity in Japan ¡ª as a means to explore religious faith and cultural difference. What preoccupies Endo is whether Western Christianity can take root in what the Inquisitor describes as ¡°this swamp of Japan,¡± which seems inhospitable to outside forces. It¡¯s a story of God, nation and myth.It¡¯s easy to understand Mr. Scorsese¡¯s interest in the novel and specifically in the character of Rodrigues. Despite the priest¡¯s piety, black vestments and narrative prominence, he is no more a Hollywood hero than most of Mr. Scorsese¡¯s falling and fallen men, with their arrogance and vanity. Rodrigues cowers in fear, recoils from his flock and assures himself of the goodness that the church ¡ª and he, by extension ¡ª has brought. (He pities the worshipers but is proud of his ministering.) His faith, including in himself, sustains Rodrigues, but even as he tends to the souls of the hidden Christians he fails to ease their earthly suffering. God is silent; in a way, so is this most ardent missionary. The silence of the title resounds insistently; it¡¯s in the screams of the faithful and in Rodrigues¡¯s endless searching. Why, he agonizes with no self-awareness, does God not answer prayers and alleviate suffering, a question which proves too heavy a load for Mr. Garfield¡¯s talents. When he plays against the other actors, he can seem as decorative as a plaster saint (his luxuriously styled hair is right out of a 1950s biblical epic), which makes the other performers and their characters look stronger, and works for the story. Rodrigues is weak. But it¡¯s weakness without depth or the burning belief that would make his errors shattering. When he carries on alone, speaking to God, questioning and suffering at great, monotonous length, his weakness becomes tedious, as does the film.¡°Silence¡± argues against orthodoxy, but its messenger is too pallid. This is less the fault of Mr. Garfield than of Mr. Scorsese¡¯s conception of Rodrigues as the story¡¯s fulcrum instead of its void. Mr. Scorsese fills the film with haunting tableaus and performances ¡ª including from Tadanobu Asano, as the Interpreter ¡ª that tug from the edges, pulling attention away from its center. In the end, nothing that Rodrigues says resonates as deeply as Inoue¡¯s terrifying, teasing whine, which conveys the larger cultural and political stakes; nothing imparts the mystery of creation as potently as the flicker of a darting emerald lizard or an eerie parade of cats prowling through a spookily deserted village.These moments shake ¡°Silence¡± and you too; the movie could use more jolts, more trembling, more surrealism; maybe, as in ¡°The Last Temptation of Christ,¡± a talking lion to go along with its trippy lizard. ¡°Silence¡± is as visually striking as you might expect, but also overly tidy, clean and decorous, despite its tortured flesh, its mud and its blood. There¡¯s a crushing lack of urgency to this story and its telling, perhaps because it took Mr. Scorsese, who wrote the script with Jay Cocks, so long to make ¡°Silence.¡± It¡¯s disappointing because few directors can engage doubt and belief as powerfully as Mr. Scorsese can, but also because doubt and belief have again set the world on fire.",0.691394310616332,"Drama"

Those are the high points of the movie, quick and nasty riffs to remind you of ¡°Trainwreck¡± and raise your hopes for something similar. Those hopes are both fulfilled and disappointed.Like most popular big-screen comic performers, Ms. Schumer is committed to consistency, or at least to exploiting a successful and familiar persona. She has become more or less what Will Ferrell was a decade and a half ago: the likable embodiment of various forms of human unpleasantness, a soft-bodied clown whose immunity to shame represents an appealing kind of innocence. Emily is self-absorbed, lazy and rude, but also so lacking in true meanness or guile and so dogged in her pursuit of shallow pleasures that she¡¯s kind of fun to be around. Even though she drinks too much, says obnoxious things and misbehaves in other ways ¡ª killing two people, for example, one with a shovel and the other with a harpoon ¡ª it¡¯s impossible to get mad at her, or even seriously annoyed.That¡¯s her mother¡¯s job. ¡°Snatched¡± is an intergenerational buddies-on-the-run movie, a strangely popular subgenre nowadays. Emily¡¯s mom, Linda, is played by Goldie Hawn, who has been funny for a good half-century (going back to ¡°Laugh-In¡±) and who is cruelly and inexplicably denied that privilege here. Linda, long-divorced and devoted to her two children (Emily¡¯s toxic-nerd brother is played by Ike Barinholtz), functions as an uptight, anxious foil to her wildly undisciplined daughter. In principle that may be a slightly stale premise. In practice it¡¯s just dull, and it¡¯s frustrating to see Ms. Hawn robbed of the opportunity to be silly.Supplemental silliness is supplied, instead, by Mr. Barinholtz, by Wanda Sykes and Joan Cusack (as a pair of intense tourists), by Christopher Meloni (as an Amazonian adventurer) and by Bashir Salahuddin (as a State Department bureaucrat). The story is nowhere near as hilarious as the director, Jonathan Levine, and the screenwriter, Katie Dippold, would like us to believe. (And not up to the standard of ¡°The Heat¡± or ¡°Ghostbusters,¡± both of which Ms. Dippold was also involved in.) Emily drags Linda on a trip to Ecuador that turns calamitous when the two women are kidnapped by a gang of South American baddies. By ¡°calamitous¡± I mean lazy, sloppy and witless. ¡°Snatched¡± is one of those movies that subscribes to a dubious homeopathic theory of cultural insensitivity by which the acknowledgment of offensiveness is supposed to prevent anyone from taking offense. The idea is that if you use variations on the phrase ¡°That¡¯s racist!¡± as a punch line a few times, nothing else you say or do could possibly be racist. Including, say, populating your movie with dark-skinned thugs with funny accents and killing a few of them for cheap laughs.Ms. Schumer has been criticized for this kind of thing before, and I suppose there¡¯s a certain integrity in blithely refusing to care. It¡¯s also true that comedy can be forgiven for a lot as long as it manages to make you laugh. Which ¡°Snatched¡± did, in my case, a handful of times, including when Emily has a tapeworm and when her brother reaches out to the State Department for help rescuing his mother and sister. But though this movie ostensibly celebrates the spirit of adventure and openness to experience, it takes no risks and blazes no trails.

Mr. Malick, one of cinema¡¯s philosopher kings, embraces fluidity as a visual principle and his films are filled with life¡¯s ebb and flow ¡ª its swirling waters, swooping birds, stirring trees, billowing curtains, and gliding people and cameras. He loves silence and stillness, and the image of sunlight caressing a woman¡¯s motionless face. But he is a searcher, and that searching informs his visual style with its restless, moving pictures.There¡¯s much to take in here, including the film¡¯s narrative fragmentation, which requires you to go with the flow as you also puzzle together the story¡¯s parts, themes and circling characters: Faye (Rooney Mara), a musician trying to find her way in Austin, Tex.; Cook (Michael Fassbender), a music producer and Faye¡¯s sometime lover; and BV (Ryan Gosling), a musician and Faye¡¯s other lover. A few other lovelies float in as well, including Rhonda (a moving Natalie Portman), a waitress who marries Cook; Amanda (Cate Blanchett), who has an affair with BV; and Zoey (B¨¦r¨¦nice Marlohe), who has an affair with Faye. Holly Hunter, Iggy Pop, Johnny Rotten and Val Kilmer also drop in.Mr. Malick began embracing narrative fragmentation years ago and it has increasingly characterized his films. Most movies rely on formulas, employing three or four acts, story beats and character arcs that are so standard you almost intuitively know when something will happen if not what. There will be a crisis; there will be a tidying up. ¡°Song to Song¡± has distinct sections, but Mr. Malick frames them his own way. They move the narrative forward, but inside these sections time can seem to stutter, like a song on repeat. Many scenes are so short that they don¡¯t seem to be overtly driving the story forward, but instead pile up and nearly swirl, like leaves caught in a gust. The first section traces the earlier, joyful moments shared by Faye, Cook and BV; by the final section, Faye is stepping once more into a natural pool of water, challenging Heraclitus¡¯s observation that you cannot step into the same river twice (life changes). Throughout, Mr. Malick inserts shots and short scenes that seem more like shards of memory, like those flashes from the past that suddenly materialize in the temporal slipstream. Faye and Cook gaze at each other warily; Faye and BV embrace; Faye and Cook embrace; at one point, all three fly off in a private plane to Mexico, where they cavort on a beach, wander around and get drunk amid a relay of looks. During this idyll, play turns into a rehearsal for a possible future that¡¯s telegraphed by a baby whom BV holds in one scene and by a tiny, elderly woman trembling alone in another scene. Cook also speaks in muted voice-over about Faye and BV as if telling himself a story. ¡°They have a beauty in their life,¡± he murmurs, ¡°that makes me ugly.¡± You have to take his word for it, because there¡¯s very little here that¡¯s intentionally ugly in ¡°Song to Song.¡± Ugliness hovers like a threat, but is often only inadvertently conveyed, as when the film reduces Mexicans to touristic props. Cook, by contrast, just seems like a rich, bored henhouse fox who throws parties where women wait to be chosen and where one lies on a table like a centerpiece, food covering her naked body.Cook¡¯s world is a stage show or so he tells BV, a sentiment that Mr. Malick seems to share. It¡¯s a beautiful, seductive show, an endless carnival (with little actual work or sweat) filled with jostling, occasionally colliding bodies that ¡ª whether playing onstage, thrashing in a mosh pit or seductively grinding on the floor ¡ª seem to be reaching, reaching, always reaching for something beyond these earthly, fleeting, sensual delights. As in Mr. Malick¡¯s 2016 film ¡°Knight of Cups¡± (about a screenwriter), sex and especially sex without love inevitably proves to be a crucial false promise, a temptation that leads to suffering, cascading tears and sometimes catastrophic, even fatal falls.¡°Song to Song¡± continually flits ¡ª like the butterfly seen in one fleeting shot ¡ª from theme to theme, from love (always love) to fidelity, betrayal, identity, art, freedom, captivity, forgiveness and mercy. God is there, too, in nature and in the glowing, streaming sunlight, but also in a Madonna painted on the side of a building and in a Leonardo drawing of the Virgin Mary. The Leonardo shows up in a scene with Patti Smith, who plays herself (St. Patti) and compares Mary¡¯s face to Faye¡¯s. Ms. Smith tears a hole in the film because she¡¯s so thrillingly present, so alive; playing against Ms. Smith, Ms. Mara seems lost and she just disappears, poof, like a snuffed-out candle.Despite Ms. Smith¡¯s electric sincerity this exchange finally feels false because Ms. Mara can¡¯t convey the interiority that it requires, the kind of astonishing inner truth ¡ª call it a fever or call it grace, passion or holiness ¡ª effortlessly expressed by Ms. Smith and manifest in Leonardo¡¯s Madonna. Mr. Malick¡¯s filmmaking, with its storytelling ellipses and visual fragments, places a heavy burden on his performers, who need to build their characters primarily through individual voice-overs and in onscreen silence or near-silence, in gestures and movement. Mr. Fassbender does this brilliantly; too often, Ms. Mara and Mr. Gosling seem to be running through different acting exercises. ¡°Song to Song¡± is filled with beautiful people adrift in beautiful (glass) houses and natural settings. All this loveliness has its pleasures, but Mr. Malick¡¯s visual choices also give the film a commercial luster that can rob that beauty of its power. That¡¯s partly because the advertising world and mainstream cinema have long pilfered his aesthetic, turning it into a sales pitch. Mr. Malick is enraptured with beauty as an expression of God and as a path to God. But in ¡°Song to Song¡± both the familiarity of his aesthetic and the inability of some of his actors to summon an inner light create immaculately photographed surfaces rather than immanence. You see the poses, not the divine.That¡¯s disappointing, even if there¡¯s also much here that¡¯s exhilarating, including the film¡¯s ambitions and its seriousness. Seriousness in cinema is often viewed with suspicion and that¡¯s as true now as it was when, say, Antonioni shook up the art. The difference is that now seriousness (and beauty and grace) is rarely part of a wider discussion, because that conversation is dominated by corporate cinema, where there¡¯s often little to argue over and get excited by. There is, by contrast, much to admire in ¡°Song to Song¡± and much to argue with, including its ideas about pleasure and women. So go, fall into its embrace, resist its charms, argue.

For decades, the residents of the tiny Tuscan town of Monticchiello have turned their lives into theater. Each year, they gather to discuss art and their world until they land on a topic that reflects their most recent, urgent concerns. Word by word, they push and pull, challenging one another as they shape a production. All the world¡¯s a stage, but in Monticchiello that truism is movingly real, especially because these days its aging resident-players have more exits than entrances.Perched on a hilltop some two hours south of Florence, Monticchiello tends to be one of those towns that in English-language guidebooks rates a line or two in between chapters on Florence and Venice. One such book mentions the town¡¯s ¡°Teatro Povero (a folk theater production)¡±; another notes its ¡°forbidding walls¡± and ¡°medieval past,¡± assuring readers that it¡¯s ¡°well worth exploring¡± even if over all ¡°there is nothing much in the way of sights.¡± These mercenary assessments are meant, of course, for harried, hurried travelers, including those of us lucky enough to shape a few precious days into something we call vacation.In their documentary ¡°Spettacolo,¡± Jeff Malmberg and Chris Shellen stay a while. Their most obvious subject is the annual production that Monticchiello townspeople have mounted since the 1960s, when some could remember the Fascist occupation firsthand. In the early years, the residents put on pageants that, at least from the modest documentation in the movie, seem like elaborations on other regional events, like the centuries-old horse race called the Palio in nearby Siena. At some point, the Monticchiello residents turned to the more immediate past, revisiting, for instance, the trauma of the war and the day Nazis lined the villagers up, threatening to shoot them all. More recently, the economy has fueled the spettacolo, which the movie¡¯s notes define as ¡°performance, spectacle or play.¡± That was certainly the case in 2012, when the bulk of the movie was shot over a period of six months. In interviews, Mr. Malmberg has said that he and Ms. Shellen happened on Monticchiello while on a vacation. (Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen, who are married, share directing credit; he shot and edited the documentary, and she recorded sound.) They were ambling around, rather like the day trippers in the documentary, when they accidentally came across Andrea Cresti, an artist who turned out to be theater¡¯s longtime director as well as the portal into this story. There¡¯s very little about the making of the documentary itself in ¡°Spettacolo,¡± which assumes the point of view of the unobtrusive, not-quite omniscient witness. The people tell their stories directly on camera, at times with deep emotion, their reminiscences augmented by faded photographs and archival moving images. The history of the theater emerges gradually as assorted personalities ¡ª former partisans, an ailing woman, an indifferent son ¡ª click into place. Perhaps inevitably, Mr. Cresti, a charismatic figure with a gray beard and a leonine halo of hair, becomes the focal point as he struggles to turn the town¡¯s latest collective concerns into its next big show.As the spettacolo takes shape with fractious dialogue and insistent politics, it becomes evident that the filmmakers are less interested in the final play than in its production, in its process and multiple meanings. Nothing if not discreet (and sly), Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen have shaped much of their material into four chapters that are named for the seasons. Each chapter is accompanied by ah-and-ooh beauty shots of the region, yet as winter gives way to spring and brown hills turn green, the day-to-day lives of the townspeople create a gentle, insistent critique of these seasonal postcards. Much like the town¡¯s annual production, the movie is telling its own story dialectically.That story can be so poignant and is so intelligently told that it feels wrong, almost insulting, to call ¡°Spettacolo¡± charming, even if the movie is often delightful. In guidebooks, charm tends to be a commercial marker, a signifier for an imaginary, easily salable and consumable notion of authenticity. Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen understand the allure of that imaginary world; they were, after all, on vacation when they discovered Monticchiello and their documentary is itself often lovely. Yet they remind you that people are not attractions and their homes are not museums, even if the global economy, its casual tourists and rich speculators are determined to prove otherwise.",0.994607738129278,"Documentary"

Once more, it spins on Peter Parker (the nice, boyish Tom Holland), a teenager who develops super-skills after he¡¯s bitten by a troublesome spider. The title of the likable, amusing ¡°Spider-Man: Homecoming¡± indicates that this is a return, though to what exactly? To Queens? To youth? The rest of us can¡¯t go home again, but given that this is the second Spider-Man reboot in 15 years from Sony Pictures it seems Spidey has few other options.¡°Homecoming¡± is more or less about how Peter Parker needs to stay forever young, ideally 15 or so years old. What¡¯s always been most appealing about Spider-Man is that he¡¯s a kid, if one who can spin big, sticky webs and swing from rooftop to rooftop, comparatively rinky-dink talents in the flying, magic-hammering superhero world. What makes Spider-Man different and, ideally, work as a character, giving him an off-kilter charm, is he retains the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of adolescence. For all his super-gifts and despite the weird and dangerous company he keeps, he is also a teenage boy ¡ª that¡¯s his Kryptonite, what cuts him down to recognizable human size.The team behind ¡°Homecoming¡± certainly gets that Spider-Man is a kid, even if the movie plays the na<U+00EF>f angle too hard at times, making Peter look not just inexperienced but also silly, a borderline dumb cluck. The movie ¡ª credited to six writers and directed by Jon Watts ¡ª opens sometime after Peter has been bitten. He¡¯s still trying to get his bearings and struggling to figure out the limits of his powers, which is complicated here by the fact that this is the first Spider-Man movie that Sony has made with Marvel Studios. It¡¯s a liaison that has brought Spider-Man into the Marvel worldwide domination machine, which is why he¡¯s being mentored in the way of the superhero by Marvel¡¯s Iron Man, a.k.a. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., who pops in and out). That machine, known to executives and true believers as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is vast, complicated, lucrative and ever-expanding. It¡¯s also intrinsically uninteresting for viewers (at least one!) who just want a good movie. Marvel has produced a string of movies of wildly divergent quality, but Sony has had a tougher time coming up with regular superhero successes. And so, after stumbling with its first ¡°Spider-Man¡± resurrection, it cut a deal with Marvel, which is also not inherently interesting. Even so it¡¯s modestly amusing to consider that Sony, much like Peter Parker here, needed help getting off the ground again, and so Marvel stepped in to play its Tony Stark-like guide. For its initial hour, ¡°Homecoming¡± moves along breezily enough, though sometimes with too much forced airiness. It works best when it sticks close to Peter and is content to be a light, good-natured story of a teenager who¡¯s navigating through, and often badly fumbling, the competing demands of school, home and his emergent Spidey self. Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teenager than the actors who¡¯ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter¡¯s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing.Mr. Watts¡¯s previous features include ¡°Cop Car,¡± a slick, small-scaled nail-biter about two boys in peril that showed he knows where to put the camera, is good with actors and has a sadistic streak, which together presumably clinched his big-studio future. ¡°Cop Car¡± is such an exercise in pressure-cooker cinema that it¡¯s surprising how tamped down the sense of danger is in ¡°Homecoming,¡± even in some of the earlier sequences in which Peter is still puzzling out how to scuttle and swing as he vanquishes villainy. A brief scene of him sneaking into his bedroom (to avoid Marisa Tomei¡¯s Aunt May) has more tension than any single action set piece.It¡¯s tough to know who the biggest creative force is in a corporate entity like ¡°Homecoming¡± and how much Mr. Watts contributed to its look, vibe and feel. The movie isn¡¯t visually distinctive over all, and while some of the better action scenes stick low to the ground, as when Spider-Man crashes through suburban backyards and plays bumper cars with trash cans, the airborne special-effects scenes are disappointingly lackluster, particularly in the age of ambitious, eye-stroking diversions like ¡°Doctor Strange.¡± It¡¯s hard to think of a single image in ¡°Homecoming¡± that will transcend a first viewing the way that Peter and M. J.¡¯s tender, topsy-turvy kiss did in Sam Raimi¡¯s first ¡°Spider-Man.¡±And then there¡¯s Michael Keaton, who¡¯s so very good in ¡°Homecoming¡± that he suggests a future narrative path down which the older, more experienced Spider-Man might eventually go if ever allowed to truly grow up. Mr. Keaton plays the Vulture, the regulation baddie, who after weaponizing some extraterrestrial leftovers has become a criminal mastermind, with the usual yelling, minions and death. He flies around in a clunky winged apparatus that looks like something from the Wright Brothers¡¯ steampunk phase. This makes for an amusing chunk of heavy-metal d¨¦cor, but is mostly resonant as a tepid joke about Mr. Keaton¡¯s aerial acrobatics in ¡°Batman¡± and ¡°Birdman.¡± The Vulture is a mess of prickly contradictions, only some of which seem intentional. His criminality, rage and perhaps his madness have been stoked by class resentment and Mr. Keaton, with his white-hot menace and narrowing eyes, makes him a memorably angry man, not a caricature. The Vulture becomes a narrative counterweight to Tony Stark¡¯s self-satisfied billionaire. But the Vulture is also the biggest enemy facing Spider-Man, who ¡ª as this movie reminds you ¡ª is a working-class kid turned superhero. Here, Spidey is eager to do a billionaire¡¯s bidding, partly because he¡¯s being readied to join the Avengers. The question is when Spidey really grows up, who will he fight for and why?",0.202198159816383,"Action"

Night Shyamalan. Or maybe I should say a return to formula. The movie, shot in and around Philadelphia, Mr. Shyamalan¡¯s hometown, proceeds nimbly and with suave misdirection toward a pair of rug-pulling final twists that an attentive viewer will probably be able to anticipate. It¡¯s not exactly a Choose Your Own Adventure, but you can opt either for the pleasure of surprise at the end or for the satisfaction of working out the puzzle as you go along.Thanks to ¡°The Sixth Sense¡± and ¡°Unbreakable¡± back around the turn of the century, Mr. Shyamalan stands as a pioneer of spoiler-centric cinema. Like those movies, and like his later, lesser entertainments (¡°The Village¡±; ¡°The Happening¡±), ¡°Split¡± is all plot, an ingenious (and also ridiculous) conceit spun into an elegant ribbon of suspense. The less said about that plot, therefore, the better. What I can safely divulge is that three teenage girls are kidnapped after a birthday party by a close-cropped guy named Dennis in a buttoned-up shirt. He is obsessed with cleanliness, and he sounds weirdly like John Turturro for a guy supposedly from Philly. In fact, Dennis is played by the soft-eyed, shape-shifting British actor James McAvoy, as are the other 23 personalities residing in the body of a guy who shares the surname of a famous (and famously odd) Philadelphia-born artist. These ¡°alters¡± ¡ª a word familiar to fans of the Showtime series ¡°United States of Tara¡± and other pop-cultural treatments of a controversial and often poorly understood psychological disorder ¡ª are a diverse bunch. Some are male, some female, at least one is a child (named Hedwig) and another (named Barry) is a gay stereotype. What they want with their captives is not immediately clear. What Mr. Shyamalan wants is to strip them down to their underwear and to explore, exploit and occasionally subvert the basic tropes of the female-victim psycho-slasher movie.One of the young women ¡ª a gothy, spooky misfit named Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) ¡ª is singled out for special attention from the camera (though not, at least initially, from Dennis and his colleagues). Her fellow abductees, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula), alternate between panic and defiance, but Casey counsels patience and watchfulness. Flashbacks to a hunting trip she took as a 5-year-old (Izzie Leigh Coffey) in the company of her father (Sebastian Arcelus) and uncle (Brad William Henke) seem to explain the source of her survival skills, though it turns out that those memories have another, darker meaning as well.Dennis and company, meanwhile ¡ª it¡¯s mostly Barry, actually ¡ª consult with a therapist, Dr. Fletcher, who lives alone in a gracious, book-stuffed rowhouse and who is played by the wonderful Betty Buckley. Dr. Fletcher¡¯s primary function is to explain the movie to the audience, foreshadowing the climax with her heterodox pseudo-scholarly theories about her many-sided patient, but Ms. Buckley also provides a dimension of warmth and wit that ¡°Split¡± would be much duller and uglier without. Mr. McAvoy, for his part, revels in the chance to use his sensitivity for evil, and to showboat his way through a series of appropriately overwrought characterizations. This breathlessly melodramatic thriller shouldn¡¯t be taken as a psychological case study, any more than Mr. Shyamalan¡¯s laughable ¡°Lady in the Water¡± should be mined for clues about the habits of film critics. ¡°Split¡± is lurid and ludicrous, and sometimes more than a little icky in its prurient, maudlin interest in the abuse of children. It¡¯s also absorbing and sometimes slyly funny. Some years back ¡ª it¡¯s startling to contemplate just how long ago it was ¡ª Mr. Shyamalan was puffed up into a cinematic visionary, hailed on the cover of Newsweek as ¡°The Next Spielberg.¡± That hype (and his own self-aggrandizing tendencies) placed a disproportionate burden of significance on a filmmaker who has always been, at heart, a superior genre hack.¡°Split¡± is being released by Universal under the Blumhouse label, a brand associated with unpretentious, clever, neo-traditionalist scare-pictures like ¡°Insidious,¡± ¡°Paranormal Activity¡± and ¡°The Purge.¡± That seems like the right company for Mr. Shyamalan, and the January pre-Oscar doldrums may be the perfect moment to appreciate his skills. He is a master of mood, pace and limited perspective, moving the camera so that the thing you most desperately want to see ¡ª and are most afraid of seeing ¡ª remains teasingly out of sight.He uses Ms. Taylor-Joy¡¯s enormous dark eyes as a mirror and a lure for the audience¡¯s attention. He delays the inevitable, inevitably deflationary revelations for as long as possible, minimizing the obligatory third-act flurry of chasing, fighting and bloodletting. And he sneaks in a few self-referential winks, including an allusion to his last really good movie that feels at once like a promise of better mischief to come and an implicit apology for all the disappointment in between.",0.11203765567936,"Horror"

The Resistance ¡ª an intrepid, multi-everything group whose leaders include a battle-tested woman warrior ¡ª has been fighting the good fight for years but is outnumbered and occasionally outmaneuvered. Yes, the latest ¡°Star Wars¡± installment is here, and, lo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever).¡°Star Wars: The Last Jedi¡± picks up where the story left off two years ago in ¡°The Force Awakens,¡± the leadoff of the series¡¯ newest trilogy. Keeping track of where each ¡°Star Wars¡± title fits into the overall scheme of things can be brain-numbing (the movies weren¡¯t made in story-chronological order), but the strongest ones work as stand-alones and let you just go with the onscreen flow. The writer-director of ¡°The Last Jedi,¡± Rian Johnson, frontloads the critical back story intel ¡ª who¡¯s fighting who and the like ¡ª in the opening crawl. And then he gets down to the difficult business of putting his fingerprints on a franchise that deliberately resists individual authorship. Mr. Johnson largely succeeds despite having inherited an elaborate ecosystem with a Manichaean worldview divided between heroes (a.k.a. the Resistance) and villains (the First Order). That¡¯s about all you need to know to follow this movie, which charts the franchise¡¯s future while continuing to pass the baton from its first holy trinity ¡ª Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill ¡ª to a new trio, introduced in ¡°The Force Awakens.¡± Mr. Ford¡¯s character, Han Solo, exited the series in that movie. As Leia, Ms. Fisher plays a critical role in this new one, but her death last December (after production ended) imparts real melancholy to a series that from its start has been defined ¡ª if not always comfortably ¡ª by loss. And so, once upon a time yet again, peace remains elusive and weapons are locked, loaded and often firing. Here, the fight continues with Leia searching for her absent brother, Luke Skywalker (Mr. Hamill), while leading the Resistance against the First Order, the dark-side successor to the dictatorial Empire (Darth Vader¡¯s cohort). The old Imperial evildoers have been replaced by the suitably cartoonish-sounding Snoke (created by the hard-working Andy Serkis and digital effects), a wormy, towering ghoul with vivid scars and an insinuating sneer. He commands the usual stormtroopers along with the impetuous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a charismatic villain who has closely fashioned himself after Vader. The story is a tangle, but its complications are mitigated by Mr. Johnson¡¯s quick pace and the appealing performers. Like most contemporary action flicks, this one more or less plays out as a succession of fights, chases and time outs (for chatting, scheming or lonely musing) across two or more plot lines. Having joined together in ¡°The Force Awakens,¡± the story¡¯s latest dream team ¡ª Rey (Daisy Ridley), a scavenger turned warrior; Finn (John Boyega), a First Order deserter turned resister; and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a Resistance fighter pilot ¡ª now often spends time apart. Poe spins in Leia¡¯s orbit while Rey pesters Luke, and Finn finds a winning ally (Kelly Marie Tran).An early heroic death sets the sober mood and stakes while gently re-establishing the franchise¡¯s new commitment to diversifying the overall picture. As in ¡°The Force Awakens,¡± this inclusion feels natural, a vision of the future you can recognize. About the only time it feels as if Mr. Johnson is checking ¡°Star Wars¡± boxes is in some of the fights, especially during an impasse that turns into a slow-moving game of space chess. He may be checking off some of those boxes in an ode to George Lucas; whatever the case, Mr. Johnson only infrequently comes across as dutiful or as overtly brand-expanding (as with a troika of calculatingly cute tykes who unnervingly suggest this series really will go on forever). One of the truisms of the ¡°Star Wars¡± series is that its battle between good and bad has always uneasily and sometimes openly mirrored the attendant struggle between good and bad filmmaking. Mr. Lucas¡¯s 1977 foundational movie mostly transcends its flaws with slick looks, hooky effects, old-school heroics and loads of marketable material that helped turn fan love into an ecumenical cult. The second trilogy, entirely directed by Mr. Lucas, began in 1999 with ¡°The Phantom Menace¡± (infamous for the minor scandal called Jar Jar Binks) and is pretty much a drag outside of some fleet light-saber duels and the arresting black-and-red patterning that distinguishes one villain. Part of what has already made the new trilogy more successful is that its directors, J.J. Abrams (¡°The Force Awakens¡±) and Mr. Johnson, are technically adept, commercially savvy ¡°Star Wars¡± true believers who came of age in the post-Lucas blockbuster era. Each has had to navigate the intricacies of Mr. Lucas¡¯s sprawling fiction while handling the deep imprint created by Darth Vader¡¯s heavy-breathing menace, R2-D2¡¯s amusing beeps, Mr. Ford¡¯s insouciance, Mr. Hamill¡¯s earnestness, and Ms. Fisher¡¯s smarts and latter-day screwball charm. Unlike Mr. Lucas, though, Mr. Abrams and Mr. Johnson don¡¯t feel burdened by that legacy; they¡¯re into it, charged up, despite the pressures of such an industrial enterprise. They¡¯re resolving their cinematic father issues with a sense of fun. Mr. Johnson can make you forget about those issues as well as the franchise¡¯s insistent obligations; it also seems like he had a good time at work. He brings lightness to his banter, visual flair (not simply bleeding-edge special effects) to the design, and narrative savvy to Rey and Kylo Ren¡¯s relationship. Mr. Johnson¡¯s use of deep red is characteristic of how he turns ideas into images, most vividly with a set that looks like something Vincente Minnelli might have dreamed up for a Flash Gordon musical with Gene Kelly. When that set becomes the backdrop to a viscerally exciting fight, all the red abruptly evokes the spilled blood that this otherwise squeaky clean series insistently elides.Like ¡°The Force Awakens,¡± ¡°The Last Jedi¡± engages with the first ¡°Star Wars¡± movie less as a fetish than as a necessary point of departure. And, like Alec Guinness¡¯s Obi-Wan Kenobi once did, Luke comes off as a brooding monastic loner. With a hooded robe, beard and inexplicable moodiness, he has retreated to an eerily lovely, isolated island where imaginatively designed critters roam and trill. The cutest (right in time for Christmas tie-ins) are Porgs, saucer-eyed mewling creatures with plump, puffin-like bodies that are mainly on hand for easy laughs. The creature design throughout is so inventive ¡ª there are less-fuzzy whatsits on the island, too ¡ª that you wish more had been added. You feel Mr. Johnson periodically reining himself in, yet the movie cuts loose when he does, as when he embraces the galaxy¡¯s strangeness, its non-humanoid beings as well as its magic and mystery. There¡¯s a trippy scene in which a character floats into a resurrection, an ethereal drift that borders on the surreal. It¡¯s a fleeting bliss-out in a series that knows how to bring the weird but has too often neglected to do so amid its blaster zapping, machinations and Oedipal stressing and storming. This is, after all, a franchise in which the most indelible character remains Yoda, the wee, far-out philosophizer with the tufted pate and syntactically distinct truth telling: ¡°Wars not make one great.¡±Wars do, however, make warehouses of money as this franchise has been affirming for decades. It¡¯s instructive how normalized its permanent war has become, with its high body count, bloodlessness and fascist chic (the black uniforms evoking the Nazi SS). Given this, it¡¯s notable, too, that while Mr. Johnson manages the big-canvas battles well enough, he¡¯s better with smaller-scaled fights, in which the sweat, vulnerabilities and personal costs of violence are foregrounded. With Mr. Driver ¡ª who delivers a startlingly raw performance ¡ª Mr. Johnson delivers a potent portrait of villainy that suggests evil isn¡¯t hard-wired, an inheritance or even enigmatic. Here, it is a choice ¡ª an act of self-creation in the service of annihilation.Mr. Johnson has picked up the baton ¡ª notably the myth of a female Jedi ¡ª that was handed to Mr. Abrams when he signed on to revive the series with ¡°The Force Awakens.¡± Mr. Johnson doesn¡¯t have to make the important introductions; for the most part, the principals were in place, as was an overarching mythology that during some arid periods has seemed more sustained by fan faith than anything else. Even so, he has to convince you that these searching, burgeoning heroes and villains fit together emotionally, not simply on a Lucasfilm whiteboard, and that they have the requisite lightness and heaviness, the ineffable spirit and grandeur to reinvigorate a pop-cultural juggernaut. That he¡¯s made a good movie in doing so isn¡¯t icing; it¡¯s the whole cake.",0.998163807032742,"Action"

Mr. Guiraudie, whose earlier films include ¡°Stranger by the Lake,¡± has an eye for rural French landscapes and an ear for deadpan conversation.

His ¡°All the Real Girls¡± (2003) and ¡°Snow Angels¡± (2007) brought acute, cleareyed, compassionate consideration to trauma and tragedy as they affect intimate relationships. Unlike those pictures, though, ¡°Stronger¡± carries a separate weight. It¡¯s also about an actual galvanic event in recent American history.¡°Stronger¡± is the story of Jeff Bauman, a resident of Chelmsford, Mass., who lost both his legs above the knee in the terrorist bombings of the Boston Marathon in 2013.The movie, based on Mr. Bauman¡¯s autobiography, begins with a depiction of him as a relatively amiable screw-up. Played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who¡¯s almost a decade older than Mr. Bauman was at the time of the events shown, the character is nevertheless a convincing man-child. After making a grisly mess of a chicken-roasting task at the Costco where he works, Jeff repairs to his local, where he drinks and curses and makes moon-eyes at his ex-girlfriend Erin (Tatiana Maslany), a rather more directed soul who¡¯s popped in to collect donations for her marathon run. Seizing on a notion to win her back, Jeff hand-letters a sign to brandish near the race¡¯s finish line. He sees one of the bombers moments before the explosion that costs him his legs.

For instance, Jeff¡¯s mother, Patty, in an astounding turn by Miranda Richardson, is a slovenly, resentful, egocentric drunk who frequently prioritizes her hangovers over Jeff¡¯s physical rehabilitation appointments.

The emotions and situations depicted, as Jeff struggles with PTSD, his immobility, his relationship with Erin and his hometown-hero status (which he believes to be completely unearned), are raw, sometimes desperate. A scene late in the film in which Jeff begs not to be abandoned is played at such a high pitch that it flirts with, then transcends, bathos.But as it approaches the two-hour mark, the movie seems to wake to the fact that it has to live up to its title.

This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact. Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution. The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing ¡°Suburbicon¡± has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down. You know the place: It¡¯s as American as apple pie and quiet desperation. It¡¯s the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented. In ¡°Little Boxes,¡± a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the ¡°boys go into business and marry and raise a family.¡± That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that ¡°Suburbicon¡± delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home. It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardner¡¯s sack suits and yards that look as if they¡¯d been landscaped using a compass and protractor. There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like ¡°Father Knows Best¡± rather than a riposte like ¡°Mad Men.¡±The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicon¡¯s first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion. Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red. Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the family¡¯s home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage. And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack. The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin. Any resemblance to the audience watching ¡°Suburbicon¡± is as intentional as it is obvious. Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov ¡ª reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen ¡ª has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle. Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images. That there aren¡¯t any movie stars in the Mayers family, though, is an early sign that all isn¡¯t quite as balanced as it seems. Karimah Westbrook has a few good moments as Mrs. Mayers, but Leith Burke, as Mr. Mayers, barely says a word. Tony Espinosa has more to do as the couple¡¯s son, Andy.Still, the families are further aligned when, shortly after the Mayerses move in, two thugs invade the Lodge home. Except instead of simply robbing the family, they kill someone, violence that shifts the story¡¯s focus to the Lodges. It¡¯s a lurching turn as well as a missed opportunity. The story of the Mayers family is grounded in the history that clearly appeals to Mr. Clooney ¡ª it¡¯s based on events that took place in Levittown, Pa., in 1957 ¡ª but what happens to the Lodges plays like one of the Coens¡¯ signature Looney Tunes as written by James M. Cain. By the time Oscar Isaac swoops in with a fedora and a wolfish grin, the movie has become a bludgeoning pastiche.Mr. Clooney gets some things right in ¡°Suburbicon,¡± including visually and with his two appealing child actors, who together give the movie a heartbeat. As the story grows grimmer and pulpier, he plays with different registers of realism, deepens the shadows and narrows his focus, using tight close-ups and all the wood paneling to box the characters in. But he skimps on the adult characters¡¯ inner lives, and, once the narrative weight shifts to the Lodges, he never finds the tone that balances the movie¡¯s sincerity with its nihilism. One problem is that Mr. Clooney seems to believe in happy endings, however hard-earned, while the Coens ¡ª whose presence hovers throughout ¡ª are the kind of pessimists who laugh in the dark. The tones and worldviews don¡¯t jibe.The greater, graver flaw, though, the one that empties ¡°Suburbicon¡± out and turns it into a mannerist exercise, is that the movie reproduces the inequality it¡¯s ostensibly outraged by. This has less to do with star power and everything to do with emphasis and interest. It¡¯s clear even from her few scenes, including a showdown with a racist, that Ms. Westbrook could have made Mrs. Mayers a force if given the chance. Yet despite the parallel editing, despite the scenes of the mob plaguing the Mayerses ¡ª and the images of a black mother, father and son who are sometimes seen but say so little ¡ª their terror isn¡¯t about them. It¡¯s about how bad it makes white people look.",0.318876747187044,"Crime"

(An excerpt from the movie appeared on The New York Times¡¯s website in 2015.) The others are Robbie, who says he aspires to be faster than Michael Phelps, and Kelvin, who has Tourette¡¯s syndrome in addition to autism.Made over the course of two years, the documentary follows the challenges they face, both personally and as a group.

The movie also trails their parents, who raise their children ¡ª mostly teenagers ¡ª without a rule book, at times feeling isolated themselves, but finding camaraderie in one another. Near the end, Mr. McQuay says he believes that having an autistic son made him a more attentive father.Issue documentaries often struggle to come across as movies, not simply as informational tools.

Renton (Ewan McGregor) has returned to Edinburgh from Amsterdam, ready to face the music for absconding with his pals¡¯ share of the loot from the previous movie¡¯s drug deal. Simon (Jonny Lee Miller) is still scraping by on the criminal fringes, trying to transform his rundown bar into an upscale brothel. And Begbie (Robert Carlyle) ¡ª whose drug of choice has always been violence ¡ª has just wangled an appropriately bloody escape from prison. Then there¡¯s sweet, pathetic Spud (Ewen Bremner), still chasing the dragon and explaining to a support group why the biggest obstacle to sobriety is daylight saving time. His rant is hilarious, the patter rapid and twisted and defiantly, exuberantly Scots. (The script is once again by John Hodge, drawing from the novels of Irvine Welsh.) Though a few words were subtitled after I saw the film, the general absence of translation is fully in line with a middle-finger attitude that the first movie cherished and its successor urges its characters to question. To that end, Mr. Boyle wisely doesn¡¯t try to surpass, or even repeat, the mad, frenetic rhythms of the original. Gone is the druggy propulsiveness, the ecstasy of the high that injected such improbable joy into those wretched, long-ago lives. In its place is a more cautious, altogether creakier energy, one that touchingly mirrors the emotional and physical states of men who are neither as spry nor as carefree as their younger selves. Euphoria has faded, and disappointment and disillusion have moved in.But while ¡°T2¡± might be middle-aged, it¡¯s very far from moribund, the despondent base notes shouldering a story of revenge and regret, amity and acceptance.

Leading the throng in a hastily composed anti-Catholic refrain, the two have never seemed so exultantly alive. Aside from a warmly stabilizing performance by Anjela Nedyalkova as Veronika, a Bulgarian prostitute and Simon¡¯s business partner, the film¡¯s women are barely seen and quietly worn down. Kelly Macdonald reappears as a successful, adult version of the schoolgirl Renton once deflowered, but the light in her eyes has gone out. Similarly, Spud¡¯s girlfriend (Shirley Henderson) and Begbie¡¯s wife (Pauline Turner) pop in only briefly, their faces betraying decades of emotional strain.It¡¯s fitting, then, that Veronika ¡ª the only character untouched by the original movie¡¯s damaged universe ¡ª should be the catalyst for this picture¡¯s ouroboros-style ending.

The movie is partly adapted from the well-received 2013 book by The Washington Post¡¯s David Finkel, who followed survivors of a battalion he had chronicled in an earlier book. Working freehandedly, Mr. Hall contrives motivations and friendships for dramatic effect. (One of the main three returning soldiers in the movie, played by Joe Cole, who arrives in Kansas only to learn that his fianc¨¦e has left him, has been added to the mix.)The central protagonist is Adam Schumann (Miles Teller, convincingly tough), who still instinctively scans American roadsides for bombs just as he did in Iraq. He has missed crucial time with his wife (Haley Bennett, whose character and performance go beyond sympathetic-wife clich¨¦s) and young children. He is haunted by two incidents for which he feels responsible: his imperfect rescue of a comrade shot in the head, seen in a prologue, and another death, revealed only gradually, that left his wife¡¯s friend Amanda Doster (Amy Schumer, in a successfully counterintuitive bit of casting) a widow. The other principal character is Tausolo Aeiti (Beulah Koale, a newcomer), who suffers from crippling memory loss that hampers daily functioning. As with Adam, part of Tausolo¡¯s trouble is admitting his problems to himself. The movie argues that the military stifles such breakthroughs on two fronts: first with a culture that encourages stoicism, second with a failure to provide prompt medical care for veterans.Striving for the elusive goal of political neutrality, Mr. Hall has made a less jingoistic film than ¡°American Sniper¡± (in the combat sequences, villainous Iraqis have been replaced with faceless ones). Instead, ¡°Thank You for Your Service¡± is a macho weepie, whose message ¡ª that wars are permanent for those who fight in them ¡ª has broad appeal.That Iraq seems unlikely to produce another ¡°The Best Years of Our Lives¡± has as much to do with changes in Hollywood craft as with the divisiveness of the war.

They may argue about whether our ever-proliferating political, ecological, technological and zombie-infested nightmares offer caution or consolation. Think about how bad things could get! But then again: Look how much worse they could be. Reality, meanwhile, inspires these dire visions and competes with them for sheer relentless awfulness.All of which is to say that ¡°The Bad Batch,¡± a messy, sunbaked pop-culture cobbler written and directed by Ana Lily Amirpour, is both a bummer and a blast. It conjures a bare-bones, moderately plausible near future in which criminals and other undesirables are subjected to a modern variant of the ancient practice of ostracism. After being tattooed behind the ear, members of the Bad Batch are abandoned on the far side of a border fence ¡ª we don¡¯t know who paid for it ¡ª with a jug of water and a fast-food hamburger.The opening sequence accompanies a young woman named Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) through this process. Her possessions include a couple of pairs of skimpy shorts, some voluntary skin ink and a sullen attitude. She wears the Bad Batch designation as a badge of honor.But Arlen and the audience quickly learn that there are degrees of badness in this universe. The desert castaways have organized themselves into makeshift societies, two of which figure prominently in Arlen¡¯s subsequent adventures. First she encounters an encampment of bodybuilders who practice cannibalism and aggressive tanning amid broken-down trailers and airplane detritus. Arlen is kidnapped, drugged, chained up and invited to dinner, one limb at a time. ¡°Y¡¯all are pure evil¡± she will say when the time for revenge arrives, and while it¡¯s hard to argue ¡ª the knowledge has literally cost her an arm and a leg ¡ª nothing is quite as simple as that. One of the people-eaters is a cute little girl named Honey (Jayda Fink) with a nonpredatory fondness for bunnies. She and her dad (Jason Momoa) ¡ª a taciturn, muscular dude identified as Miami Man by the letters inked on his chest ¡ª become part of Arlen¡¯s initially feckless, increasingly determined existence. They serve as reminders of her own inconvenient humanity.On the other side of an expanse of sandy flats, not too far from where the cannibals congregate, is a place called Comfort. A muttering wanderer (an unrecognizable Jim Carrey) deposits Arlen outside its gates. The residents of this relatively benign zone are kept safe by armed guards and ramparts made of shipping containers and kept happy with hallucinogens and dance music. The D.J. is played by Diego Luna. The patriarch of Comfort ¡ª church, state and pharmaceutical industry all at once ¡ª is a philosophical fellow with a droopy mustache and a retinue of pregnant concubines. He is played by Keanu Reeves.That fact alone might be reason enough to brace yourself for episodes of shocking violence and spend some time in Ms. Amirpour¡¯s world. Mr. Reeves in middle age is never not interesting, and he invests this role with the perfect alloy of gravity and goofiness. Happily, ¡°The Bad Batch¡± is much more than a sacrament for devotees of the Higher Keanuism. It is a fluent and knowing pastiche of genres and styles with a brazen and vigorous wit of its own.Ms. Amirpour¡¯s 2014 debut feature, the Persian-language feminist vampire melodrama ¡°A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,¡± has already acquired a cult following. Like that film, which had traces of Jim Jarmusch, David Lynch and Aki Kaurismaki in its DNA, ¡°The Bad Batch¡± is not shy about showing its influences, which appear to include ¡°Mad Max,¡± ¡°Kill Bill¡± and the lean, mean ¡¯50s oaters of Budd Boetticher.But Ms. Amirpour¡¯s films are more than a sampling of her DVD collection; her engagement with familiar themes and classic tropes is as critical as it is admiring. ¡°The Bad Batch,¡± a tale of vengeance, violence, power and redemption built on the ethical foundations of the traditional western, scrambles and satisfies expectations at the same time. Arlen walks a well-trodden path from outlaw self-preservation to righteousness, with interludes of lust, confusion and drug-enhanced stargazing. She veers toward some stereotypes and refutes others, keeping herself and the viewer in a state of perpetual unbalance. ¡°The Bad Batch¡± traffics in images and situations that evoke what used to be called exploitation movies, reveling in its own (and its heroine¡¯s) anarchic, transgressive energy.

John Wayne delivers that same admonition in ¡°Rio Bravo,¡± Howard Hawks¡¯s 1959 masterpiece about a sheriff and a ragtag group holding off a powerful, autocratic rancher. (Wayne¡¯s sheriff is chiding his alcoholic deputy, played by Dean Martin.) In large and small ways, that film and other classics from the western canon inform ¡°Lefty Brown,¡± which opens one dark, stormy night in the Montana territory in 1889, the year it became the 41st state.One of the foundational themes of the western is the making of America, an origin story that plays out in tales about frontiers, borders, wagon trains, settlements, railroads, towns, cowboys and Indians. Invariably, these are narratives of violent transformations in which land becomes property and some people become citizens while others remain outlaws or are turned into permanent exiles. In ¡°Lefty Brown,¡± those changes have already affected a Montana rancher, Edward Johnson (Peter Fonda), who has recently been elected a senator and is headed east. He¡¯s a classic type, the outsider as insider who, as he tells his wife, Laura (Kathy Baker), is ¡°going to take on all of Washington.¡± Some 10 minutes into the film, though, a villain fatally derails Edward¡¯s plans, spurring the story forward and igniting its slow-burning mystery. Laura accuses Edward¡¯s longtime hand, Lefty (Bill Pullman), of failing her husband. (¡°You were supposed to watch his back,¡± a grieving Laura tells an apologetic, equally bereft Lefty. ¡°Sorry don¡¯t get it done.¡±) Lefty sets off to find Edward¡¯s killer, a quest that becomes a journey and leads him straight into trouble. He soon meets an inexpert traveler, Jeremiah (Diego Josef), who has killed his own horse. All Jeremiah knows of the West are the romantic myths that he has learned from tattered dime novels, some of which feature fictionalized tales right out of Lefty¡¯s past. The writer-director Jared Mosh¨¦ takes his time in ¡°Lefty Brown,¡± which meanders here and there for close to two hours, ranging over picturesque, Big Sky landscapes while rambling deeper into prickly narrative complications. If there isn¡¯t much urgency it¡¯s partly because Lefty has been rather too closely modeled on the irascible if endearing coots played by the likes of Walter Brennan. Often grizzled comic relief, though sometimes tragic, these sidemen stand in the long, tall shadow of the hero, giving him grief while always following his lead. They¡¯re loyal dogs, surrogate nannies, maybe close pals. They¡¯re types that need more to carry a movie than Mr. Mosh¨¦ has given Lefty.Like Brennan¡¯s character, Stumpy, in ¡°Rio Bravo,¡± Lefty has a noticeable limp and the pitch of his voice periodically slides to lightly comedic heights. (You can hear a bit of Slim Pickens¡¯s warble, too.) At times, Lefty seems like the sum of his inspirations, which remains true even as the film progresses and settles into its groove. Central to the movie¡¯s modest pleasures is how it engages with screen history; at the same time, as the too familiar story of good men and bad, loyalty and betrayal emerges, these allusions can remind you that you¡¯re not watching Howard Hawks. Instead, Jim Caviezel and Tommy Flanagan ride up, and the plot continues to thicken amid firing guns.Mr. Pullman, his good looks obscured by chiaroscuro shadows and mutton chops, keeps you tethered to Lefty even when the rambling turns to drift. Mr. Mosh¨¦ knows his genre. There¡¯s beauty in his panoramas and charm in his reflexive gestures, typified by Jeremiah¡¯s love for the mythic heroism that foreshadows his and Lefty¡¯s future. Yet self-consciousness is also a hallmark of this genre; Douglas Fairbanks¡¯s would-be cowboy reads dime novels in the 1917 film ¡°Wild and Woolly.¡± Even so, while Mr. Mosh¨¦¡¯s ambitions can be frustratingly modest, he does know that ¡ª however fraudulent the genre¡¯s myths ¡ª the image of a man riding a horse into the sunset is in our cinematic DNA.",0.997959500034775,"Western"

In the first scenes, a young girl ventures out into the woods to collect mushrooms and finds a strange man under a tree: a Union soldier with a badly wounded leg and a charming Irish brogue. Is he a prince or an ogre? (He¡¯s Colin Farrell, which may or may not clarify the issue.)That is only one of the questions that hover in the humid, crepuscular air. The soldier, Cpl. John McBurney by name, finds himself convalescing in a plantation house, formerly a girls¡¯ boarding school, occupied by his rescuer, Miss Amy (Oona Laurence) and her teachers and classmates. The matriarch of the group ¡ª there are six of them in all ¡ª is Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman), who occupies an intriguing middle ground between fairy godmother and wicked stepmother, a zone that is familiar real estate for Ms. Kidman. Is McBurney a prisoner or a guest? Is he a threat to his hosts or is it the other way around? Who is beguiling whom? Ms. Coppola approaches these matters with her signature mix of intensity and detachment. Decorum is observed ¡ª grace is said before meals; corsets are tightened; French verbs are conjugated; everyone is called ¡°miss¡± ¡ª but under the surface all kinds of strong emotions seethe and simmer. Even at midday the place has a gloomy, twilight quality. (The cinematographer is Philippe Le Sourd.) Mist and cannon smoke from a distant battlefield hang amid the Spanish moss. The atmosphere is too genteel to be gothic, but it is haunted nonetheless, by intimations of disorder, lust and violence. ¡°Nous sommes des filles¡± the girls recite during their lessons, and ¡°The Beguiled,¡± which remakes and revises Don Siegel¡¯s 1971 film (with Clint Eastwood in Mr. Farrell¡¯s role), is in part an essay on the nuances and paradoxes of femininity. It¡¯s also the portrait of a group of ladies sorted by type and temperament. Miss Amy is sharp-witted and intellectually curious. Miss Jane (Angourie Rice), the princess of the group, is imperious and judgmental. Miss Emily (Emma Howard) is openhearted and obliging. Miss Alicia (Elle Fanning) is sullen and sneaky. Miss Edwina (Kirsten Dunst) applies herself to her duties with an air of disappointment. They find themselves competing for McBurney¡¯s favor as he sets about manipulating their vanities and insecurities, smiling like a tomcat who has stumbled into a cage full of canaries. Like many of the characters in Ms. Coppola¡¯s other films, Miss Martha and her charges dwell in a realm apart from the ordinary world, a gilded bubble that is both cocoon and prison. Some of this is a matter of circumstance. Versailles in ¡°Marie Antoinette,¡± the Chateau Marmont hotel in ¡°Somewhere,¡± the Tokyo Hyatt in ¡°Lost in Translation¡± and suburbia in ¡°The Virgin Suicides¡± and ¡°The Bling Ring¡± ¡ª all of these are environments designed to quarantine their privileged residents from the disorder and misery of life.But Ms. Coppola also chooses to emphasize this removal, to narrow the perspective of her films by turning her gaze away from certain complications. In the case of ¡°The Beguiled¡± this means that the war and its causes are banished to the margins. Occasionally a Confederate officer will show up at the gate, and the military situation sometimes arises in conversation, but the conflict is more a premise than a subject. It could be a natural disaster or a zombie-movie epidemic ¡ª a background event that provides atmosphere and structure rather than meaning.For this reason, ¡°The Beguiled¡± has generated some controversy, in particular for omitting all but the most cursory mention of slavery. While this doesn¡¯t strike me as an unfair criticism ¡ª as Corey Atad points out in Slate, an onscreen note explaining that ¡°the slaves left¡± carries understatement to the point of historical irresponsibility ¡ª it also risks applying a standard that may not be entirely relevant to Ms. Coppola¡¯s concerns. I say ¡°may not¡± because her intentions are somewhat opaque. This ¡°Beguiled¡± (based, like the Siegel-Eastwood version, on Thomas Cullinan¡¯s novel) is a study in moods and implications, picking up difficult, volatile themes and then carefully putting them down again. The earlier film is a bracingly pulpy product of its moment, a time when American movies were breaking free of repressive codes and reveling ¡ª sometimes wallowing ¡ª in sexual display and rough violence. It¡¯s smutty and disturbing and feverish, rooting around in the muck of the unconscious and the mess of the American past and digging up all kinds of disturbing stuff.None of that applies to Ms. Coppola¡¯s film, which is less interested in battling repression than in observing its mechanisms and arguing, quietly and unmistakably, for its virtues. Her ¡°Beguiled¡± is less a hothouse flower than a bonsai garden, a work of cool, exquisite artifice that evokes wildness on a small, controlled scale.I have called the film a fairy tale but you could also describe it as a horror movie, a quasi-western and a revenge melodrama, perhaps too many things at once. Most effectively, though ¡ª and largely thanks to Ms. Kidman¡¯s regal, witty performance ¡ª it¡¯s a comedy, a country-house farce about the problems caused by an inconvenient guest.",0.800053993800144,"Drama"

Outwardly, the story seems familiar: A really nice guy falls for a woman he may not be worthy of and nearly blows it. What gives the movie both fizz and sting ¡ª and shows that there¡¯s plenty of juice and possibility left in the American romantic comedy ¡ª are its particulars, especially the comic Kumail Nanjiani, who plays a fictionalized version of himself, a Pakistani-American struggling to make it in stand-up while fumbling through the rest of his life.Mr. Nanjiani (who shares his name with his character) plays a 30-ish guy navigating these two seemingly irreconcilable worlds and identities. A fledgling Chicago stand-up, Kumail is a regular at a club where, alongside his comrades ¡ª played by the real-life funny people Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler ¡ª he routinely tries to make a roomful of people laugh. One evening, he teasingly mixes it up with a customer, Emily (a wonderful Zoe Kazan), a jittery charmer with a mile-wide smile whom he soon makes moves on. Flirtation leads to one and then another night together, and before long, they¡¯re frolicking in one of those time-is-passing montages.The real Emily is Emily V. Gordon, who¡¯s married to Mr. Nanjiani. They wrote ¡°The Big Sick¡± together ¡ª it was directed by Michael Showalter ¡ª creating comedy and drama from their lives. The story tracks the giddy start of their relationship, with its dazed smiles and intimacy, a romance that seems to collapse when she discovers that he hasn¡¯t told his family about her. Kumail¡¯s parents (Anupam Kher and Zenobia Shroff, both great), who live within dining distance, are trying to find him a wife and have been parading appealing prospects before him. He wants to please his folks, but he¡¯s falling for Emily. He can¡¯t decide what to do, so she breaks it off, but then falls gravely ill. The movie¡¯s title is a giveaway: Emily¡¯s sickness is big, as well as terrifying and confounding, and it lands her in an intensive care unit, hooked to life support. Before long, she is in an induced coma; Kumail¡¯s doe eyes are watering; and you¡¯re wondering, wait, isn¡¯t this supposed to be a comedy? It is, and through sickness and nearly death, it remains a very funny one, too, producing a wide range of laughs, from staccato titters to abrupt guffaws and huge, body-shaking bursts. The ratio of jokes to screen time is satisfyingly high, and there are few stretches that aren¡¯t enlivened by humor that, joke by joke, with silliness and caustic asides, also deepens the movie. In his stand-up, Mr. Nanjiani tells longish, confessional tales about, say, his attempts to be cool in school or watching a pornographic videotape in his parents¡¯ home in Pakistan when the power went out. He can¡¯t get the tape out of the VCR, so he decides he has to ¡°pack my bags and walk the earth, which sucks because I love my parents and I¡¯m 12 years old.¡± Taken out of context, of course, any given sentence in this kind of circuitous, long-form amble doesn¡¯t sound especially funny. But Mr. Nanjiani builds the bit artfully, aided by a stealthy persona that comes across as perfectly ordinary until he deploys a puckish smile, revs up his adenoidal whine and gets his heavy eyebrows dancing.As he does in his stand-up, Mr. Nanjiani, who immigrated to the United States when he was a teenager, mines the comedy of cultural difference in ¡°The Big Sick¡± with a light, sharp touch. In another, earlier bit, he talks about a roller-coaster ride, which he calls the scariest experience of his life, adding, ¡°and I grew up in Pakistan.¡± In the movie, he drops a few terrorist-themed jokes so lightly that you¡¯re caught off guard as much by his casual delivery as by the actual gags. You sense that he¡¯s probably heard every ugly joke about Muslims imaginable, and so he¡¯s learned how to get there first, staking a claim on a contested subject, finding humor and strength in other people¡¯s stupidity.In some ways, ¡°The Big Sick¡± plays like an extended version of one of Mr. Nanjiani¡¯s anecdotal tales, though one streaked in tears and featuring a cast that includes the perfectly paired Holly Hunter and Ray Romano as Emily¡¯s parents. Mr. Showalter, whose movies include ¡°Hello, My Name Is Doris,¡± isn¡¯t much of a visual stylist ¡ª the look of this movie is basically functional plus ¡ª but he¡¯s terrific with actors and understands that even minor characters should be people, not background. In ¡°The Big Sick,¡± you vividly see the person in each role, from nurse (Myra Lucretia Taylor) to would-be bride (Kuhoo Verma), which enriches the emotional texture and underlines that there¡¯s something at stake.Ms. Kazan¡¯s work here is pivotal, especially given that she needs to make a lasting, expressive impact with Emily before the character disappears, and the narrative center of gravity shifts squarely to Kumail. In other words, you need to fall for Emily as much as Kumail does while she pokes and prods him, encouraging him to come out and play. When he¡¯s offstage, Kumail can seem as if he were waiting for something to happen, and when her parents arrive in Chicago, he recedes, turtle-like, creating a recessiveness that makes some of his deadpan discomfort even squirmier. Mostly, Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Kazan look and sound ¡ª and, importantly, feel ¡ª like people, like people you know and might fall for. I fell hard for both Ms. Kazan and Mr. Nanjiani and ¡°The Big Sick,¡± which tells a great story with waves of deep feeling and questions of identity and makes the whole thing feel like a breeze. Comedy is said to be hard; mostly, I think, by comics. Romantic comedy is apparently even tougher, at least from recent onscreen evidence. Few filmmakers know how to fit contemporary men and women, straight or gay, into narrative forms that were developed once upon a time. In ¡°The Big Sick,¡± Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Gordon vault over that hurdle with openness and delight, revitalizing an often moribund subgenre with a true story of love, death and the everyday comedy of being a 21st-century American.",0.699095636329088,"Comedy"

The hero of her book and its sequels is Parvana, a young girl we first see in this movie with her father, an out-of-work teacher. They are selling some prized possessions in a market square when Parvana¡¯s father is arrested without charges.Forbidden by roaming Taliban from so much as walking outside by herself, Parvana disguises herself as a boy to provide for her mother, older sister and baby brother. As she deals with ever-mounting difficulties, she expands on a story she and her father had started to concoct before his arrest. Depicted in cutout animation style, it tells of a young prince out to confront an elephant king.Harsh disappointments befall the characters, and they are depicted frankly, but in a way that encourages young viewers to form an affinity with the characters rather than cringe at terror. The director, Nora Twomey, has a nuanced way with characterization and action, and the voice cast, led by Saara Chaudry of ¡°Degrassi: The Next Generation,¡± is terrific.

Yes, comedies are regularly larded with ¡°old folks can¡¯t tweet¡± and ¡°these darn kids and their ¡®texting¡¯¡± jokes, while espionage thrillers invariably serve up hot webcam action. But few pictures attempt to take a hard look at what it all means ¡ª perhaps because the entertainment business has some resentment about its digital usurpation. So credit ¡°The Circle¡± with ambition, at least. This film, directed by James Ponsoldt, is an adaptation of Dave Eggers¡¯s 2013 novel, and the two collaborated on the screenplay. Mr. Eggers¡¯s book is both a satire and a cautionary tale, grafting surveillance-state mechanisms to a faux-progressive vision with pronounced cult leanings ¡ª a lot of its ¡°join us¡± vibe feels passed down from Philip Kaufman¡¯s 1978 version of ¡°Invasion of the Body Snatchers,¡± a tale set, like the one here, in the San Francisco Bay Area.Mr. Ponsoldt¡¯s movie begins with its heroine, Mae (Emma Watson), trapped in a stale cubicle doing meaningless dunning labor for a meaningless company; in due time, she¡¯s doing much more high-tech ¡°customer experience¡± work at the Circle, an internet service that seems to meld all the most annoying features of Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it. Adding to the forced-extroversion fun is a new invention, a multipurpose webcam that¡¯s the relative size and shape of an eyeball. ¡°Knowing is good but knowing everything is better,¡± crows one of the company¡¯s principals, a Steve Jobs-like visionary named Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks). That maxim also appears in the novel, and it sticks in the craw, not least because any first-year graduate student in philosophy could demolish it. At what point did the Circle put a hiring freeze on anyone conversant with epistemology? Lampooning the simple-mindedness of utopian web clich¨¦s was arguably part of Mr. Eggers¡¯s point, but much of that point is often muddled in the book. And it¡¯s simply incoherent in the movie. The novel is at its most trenchantly funny when depicting the exhausting nature of virtual social life, and it¡¯s in this area, too, that the movie gets its very few knowing laughs. But it¡¯s plain, not much more than 15 minutes in, that without the story¡¯s paranoid aspects you¡¯re left with a conceptual framework that¡¯s been lapped three times over by the likes of, say, the Joshua Cohen novel ¡°Book of Numbers,¡± or the HBO comedy series ¡°Silicon Valley.¡± You¡¯re also left with oodles and oodles of bad acting and bad dialogue.

The enervating, would-be laugh-in ¡°The Comedian¡± opens this week, presumably on the strength of its headliner, Robert De Niro. He¡¯s ill-served by this movie, but he¡¯s been worse elsewhere, which isn¡¯t much of a comfort as this one drags into hour two. Like every exalted star, Mr. De Niro generates good will because of who he is and despite his ups and downs, the afterglow of his great performances enveloping him like a luminous cloud. So it takes a significantly bad movie to wipe the audience¡¯s smile off this fast.The setup sounds promising. Mr. De Niro plays Jackie Burke, a stand-up and ex-sitcom star on a downward slide. He¡¯s not killing it the way he once did, and it takes only a few minutes onstage to see why: ¡°Let¡¯s talk about this abortion of a town you live in,¡± he tells one crowd. That¡¯s his way of warming up the room, but the chill remains palpable. Jackie is an insult comic, but his barbs have no edge, no zing, no wit. (It¡¯s unclear if they ever did.) Early on he gets a break after he attacks a heckler and the assault becomes a YouTube sensation, notoriety that earns him brief jail time and new attention. Jail turns out to be a blip on Jackie¡¯s modest, wobbly career upswing, beginning at a cable station where he and his enduringly patient agent, Miller (Edie Falco), meet the enemy: the younger generation. It¡¯s a nowhere scene, but worth mentioning because it introduces a generational divide and a patronizing attitude toward women that winds throughout. The cable executive turns out to be a tough chick, Carol (Beth Malone), a brittle smiler with short hair who puts her feet up on the table where her eager minions sit like schoolkids. The meeting is a wash (it plays like a metaphor for Hollywood), but is soon forgotten down at the soup kitchen, where Jackie is doing community service. There¡¯s a lot of story, but mostly the filmmakers rack up the miles and Jackie wears through shoe leather moving from here to there. At the soup kitchen, he finds a sympathetic (and hostage) audience in the homeless clientele and a counterweight to the cable executive in Harmony (Leslie Mann), who¡¯s also doing community service. Ms. Mann giggles and laughs too much, which fits Harmony¡¯s role as a prop. She exists to humanize Jackie, hoot at his groaners and, in one scene, gaze adoringly at him while at his feet. She beds him because she has daddy issues; their age difference suggests that the filmmakers share those issues. Mr. De Niro¡¯s old pal, Harvey Keitel, plays papa.The director, Taylor Hackford, never makes any of this pop, which isn¡¯t a surprise given the material. He also doesn¡¯t give you much to look at other than street scenery and Mr. De Niro¡¯s mug, which the actor bunches up while cycling through soft, sour moods (aggravated, exasperated), occasionally dropping a smile that might as well be a frown. It took a near-village to write the script, which is credited to Art Linson, the stand-up Jeff Ross, Richard LaGravenese and Lewis Friedman. (The stand-up Jessica Kirson, who appears in the movie, was a consultant.) Billy Crystal shows up for a heartbeat; Jimmy Walker, Charles Grodin, Richard Belzer and Cloris Leachman hang out a touch longer.Every now and then, as when Jackie is onstage ¡ª isolated in the harsh lighting and facing down a show-me world that has become increasingly foreign to him ¡ª you can see the movie that ¡°The Comedian¡± might have been. There¡¯s a kernel of an idea here about an older performer struggling to be funny in a changed reality (its technology, its women), but to pull that off would require true, deeply felt hostility, something this movie doesn¡¯t want or can¡¯t risk. Jackie isn¡¯t tough enough because the movie isn¡¯t, so his comedic personality never gels. He¡¯s meant to be an insult comic, but his discontent only rises to genuine anger with physical violence.

Based ¡ª loosely seems altogether too generous a word ¡ª on the Stephen King series, the movie is an unappealing hash of moviemaking clich¨¦s that, after much scurrying and blathering, devolves into a generic shoot¡¯em-up. About the only thing holding it together is Idris Elba, whose irrepressible magnetism and man-of-stone solidity anchors this mess but can¡¯t redeem it.Mr. Elba plays the otherworldly Roland, whose name suggests the Arthurian legend with knights and so forth. Onscreen, though, Roland basically points, shoots and serves as an overqualified babysitter for Jake (Tom Taylor), a 14-year-old with psychic powers (he ¡°shines¡± ¨¤ la ¡°The Shining¡±) who lives here and now on what Roland calls Keystone Earth. Roland, by contrast, lives in Mid-World, an incoherent realm of foggy woods, digital boogeymen, cinematic allusions, slavering nods to Mr. King¡¯s voluminous oeuvre and some geological formations that may cause you to uselessly flash on images from John Ford westerns. (The movie was partly shot in the Cederberg Mountains in South Africa.)For reasons that emerge in expository blurts, Jake and Roland travel between Mid-World and the considerably less interesting Keystone Earth. Also on the move is Walter, a.k.a. the man in black (Matthew McConaughey), an amusingly dissolute supervillain who, with weary hand waves and insinuating whispers, oozes about like a Vegas lounge lizard ¡ª with a hint of the Wicked Witch of the West snap ¨C lording over heavily armed, face-changing, blood-lusting snarlers (Jackie Earle Haley, et. al).

Jake, who tends to look as confused as the audience may feel, doesn¡¯t yet have a mission, though giving this twerp a purpose ¡ª a kind of wee hero¡¯s journey (¡°Surrender, Jake¡±!) ¡ª seems to be the endgame.

After all, if Stephen King hands you a complex fiction that turns pulpy tropes into a dense mythology with its own language and heavyweight heroes like Roland, wouldn¡¯t you run with at least some of it? The ¡°Dark Tower¡± series can be traced to Mr. King¡¯s love of, among other inspirations, J. R. R.

For a while, this slow-burn approach by the writer and director, Simon Stone, works: Stabilized by mostly unimpeachable performances, the movie hugs the rails of credibility more tightly than its melodramatic material deserves.Set in a declining Australian logging town, the drama swirls around Christian (Paul Schneider), a grumpy prodigal son. Returning home after 15 years in the United States, Christian is a newly sober drunk dragging an arsenal of anger and resentment. Its object is his father, Henry (Geoffrey Rush), owner of the town¡¯s recently shuttered sawmill and imminent bridegroom to his significantly younger and absurdly gorgeous housekeeper (Anna Torv).Separated from his long-suffering wife, Christian is made even grumpier by the marital happiness of an old school friend, Oliver (Ewen Leslie, terrific), whose familial contentment acts as a goad. Devoted to his wife and teenage daughter (Miranda Otto and a wonderfully expressive Odessa Young), Oliver, with his energy and positivity, is unprotected from Christian¡¯s vindictiveness; he¡¯s a mirror that Christian can¡¯t wait to crack.Reworking his stage adaptation of Ibsen¡¯s play ¡ª a study of weaponized truth ¡ª Mr. Stone concocts a predictable stew of ancient transgressions and undeserved recriminations.

But the intimacy needed for the tragedy to resonate is mostly lacking, and Mr. Schneider is unable to make Christian more than an instrument of combustion: Having clumsily lighted the movie¡¯s fuse, he slides into the wings.

It¡¯s another story of crushed Hollywood dreams, one that unfolds through the eyes of Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), an aspiring actor who hitched himself to a phenomenon when he met Tommy Wiseau (James Franco, Dave¡¯s brother). A would-be auteur, the real Mr. Wiseau became a minor cult figure after he released a 2003 specialty item, ¡°The Room,¡± that some anointed the worst movie ever made. In time, its notoriety started to pay off; in 2013, Mr. Sestero wrote a tell-all book.Based on that tell-all (which Mr. Sestero wrote with Tom Bissell), ¡°The Disaster Artist¡± recounts both the making of a friendship and the absurdly inept movie it produced. Greg meets Tommy in acting class, where they¡¯re both bombing out. Greg comes off as simply incompetent as he flatly fumbles through a scene from ¡°Waiting for Godot,¡± one of the movie¡¯s first jokey meta-moments. (¡°Let us do something, while we have the chance!,¡± Vladimir exclaims in ¡°Godot,¡± much as Tommy soon urges Greg.) Tommy, by vivid contrast, captivates the agape class ¡ª particularly the inhibited Greg ¡ª by turning up the volume on Stanley Kowalski while thrashing about as if demonically possessed.An odd, inexplicable friendship begins, and before long Greg and Tommy are driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, where much of the story takes place. Shacked up in Tommy¡¯s apartment, the two men try and fail to break into the entertainment business, though Greg manages to sign with a talent agency. Hope fades, as it does, amid the sunshine and smiles, and this movie slips into idle. Tommy continues to prove his lack of talent in a very funny and terrible audition; Greg finds romance with a bartender, Amber (Alison Brie). At last, inspired by Greg, Tommy ¡ª who has mysteriously deep pockets that never seem to empty ¡ª decides to direct and star in his own movie, with Greg as backup. It¡¯s a personal vision that eventually spirals into a mutual hallucination.James Franco, who also directed ¡°The Disaster Artist,¡± swoops through the movie like a star, one who has no idea that he never achieved liftoff. His face framed by a dramatic curtain of inky black hair and noticeably if discreetly modified by prosthetics, Mr. Franco certainly looks the part and sounds it too, having perfectly captured Mr. Wiseau¡¯s puzzling accent and arrhythmic intonation. Yet even at its most convincing, Mr. Franco¡¯s performance retains an interior lightness, a playfulness, including when Tommy goes emotionally dark. Mr. Franco isn¡¯t making fun of his character, at least not entirely; rather, he¡¯s put distance into the mix, as if to point out that Tommy is very much a self-made man, a construction. The making of ¡°The Room¡± gives ¡°The Disaster Artist¡± its point and much of its broad comedy. Filmmakers love making movies about movies, and Mr. Franco is no exception. (He mined similarly reflexive terrain in the very dissimilar ¡°Interior. Leather Bar.,¡± an experimental feature that he directed with Travis Mathews about the making and remaking of ¡°Cruising.¡±) Mr. Franco recreates the production of ¡°The Room¡± ¡ª and the escalating behind-the-scenes nuttiness ¡ª with an assured, energetic touch, some fitting burlesque and an appealing cast that includes Jacki Weaver and Seth Rogen, who gives his deadpan a workout to play Tommy¡¯s put-upon script supervisor.Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, ¡°The Disaster Artist¡± is a straighter, more obviously commercial-minded project than some of the other movies that Mr. Franco has directed. It¡¯s a divertingly funny movie, but its breeziness can also feel overstated, at times glib and a bit of a dodge. In ¡°The Room,¡± Mr. Wiseau comes across as somewhat menacing, with an underlying intensity that can¡¯t be entirely laughed away. (That¡¯s part of what makes the unwatchable almost watchable.) Mr. Franco¡¯s performance keeps you hooked, in large degree because of its entertaining visual spectacle. Tommy¡¯s wardrobe, for one, suggests a commitment to the 1980s and a familiarity with the defunct catalog International Male, a source for padded briefs and Jack Sparrow frippery.Yet if Mr. Wiseau is a bona fide eccentric, he proves to be not an especially interesting one in this incarnation. The filmmakers try to complicate Tommy, including with some self-referential layering that never meaningfully develops. At one point early on, Greg and Tommy visit the site where James Dean died, a pilgrimage that at once nods to Mr. Franco¡¯s breakthrough role as Dean and telegraphs one of the more ludicrous scenes in ¡°The Room.¡± Dean becomes Greg and Tommy¡¯s inspiration, a success story that they invoke while struggling to make it. But there¡¯s no sense that either remotely grasps Dean¡¯s art, which might have made their failure and ¡°The Disaster Artist¡± more resonant.Mr. Wiseau has made the most of his 15 minutes, which have already been generously extended by ¡°The Disaster Artist.¡± His website for ¡°The Room¡± suggests that he¡¯s a busy man. It lists where and how you can see the film, sometimes with him in attendance. In the synergistic spirit of Disney (but with lavish misspellings), the website also features a line of tie-in products like ¡°Room¡±-themed watches, backpacks, jackets and men¡¯s briefs emblazoned with Mr. Wiseau¡¯s name on the waistband. It¡¯s funny and somewhat depressing, which also pretty much sums up the ¡°The Room,¡± one of those cultish attractions that is so terrible it makes you wonder if the laugh finally is on us.",0.521511941621447,"Biography"

Directed by Petra Volpe, the film is set in a conservative Swiss town that has gone largely insulated from the spirit of the swinging ¡¯60s. (To judge from the film¡¯s grayish look, the locality has even escaped the decade¡¯s tie-dyed palette.)The movie centers on Nora (Marie Leuenberger), who, like most of the town¡¯s women, has been cowed into keeping her opinions to herself. ¡°The more we push, the more the men do what they want,¡± she tells a pamphleteer encouraging approval of the referendum. Nora¡¯s days consist of caring for her children, indulging her proudly retrograde father-in-law and yearning to take a job that would break the monotony. If Nora¡¯s name weren¡¯t enough of a nod to Ibsen, her husband, Hans (Max Simonischek), addresses her as ¡°my little bird.¡±But soon Nora is moved to act. Nora¡¯s rebellious teenage niece (Ella Rumpf) is sent to reform school and then, after she runs away, to prison. Nora reads up on the inequities of Swiss marriage law. A small act of defiance against the town¡¯s leading female anti-suffrage finger-wagger (Therese Affolter) wins her an ally in a feisty widow (Sibylle Brunner), and soon an Italian restaurant owner (Marta Zoffoli) joins them. Their growing movement culminates in a strike that brings the town to a halt. Taking a middlebrow, mildly rollicking approach to a serious subject, ¡°The Divine Order¡± doesn¡¯t exactly break new ground. It goes for easy laughs, like a scene in which the women attend a workshop led by a Swedish guru who teaches them a better appreciation of their anatomy. The composer, Annette Focks, supplies an array of insistent Spielbergian music cues, and the film hinges on a pair of big-speech scenes.Still, ¡°The Divine Order¡± effectively illustrates how peer pressure can influence the political process. Collective silence, whether it¡¯s from women unwilling to publicly press for their rights or men afraid to voice agreement with their wives for fear of looking weak around co-workers, proves more of an obstacle than any opponent.

One item considered particularly risible in certain corners was a pitch to the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment from a sort of youth consultant, averring that ¡°NBD,¡± shorthand for no big deal, was popular text speak among millennials and that it should be used as dialogue in a new ¡°Spider-Man¡± movie.Sony¡¯s latest release, ¡°The Emoji Movie,¡± features among its heroes a female computer hacker who at one point shrugs off a crisis by saying ¡°NBD.¡± I¡¯m not sure if this is an indication of abject cluelessness, or if it represents what I believe some millennials call a self-own.This film is exactly what its posters would lead you to believe it is: an animated narrative film about emoji. It tells the story of Gene (voiced by T. J. Miller), who is a ¡°meh¡± emoji but who is capable of making more expressions than the blas¨¦ one he has been assigned. His versatility is considered a malfunction, even, to some extent, by Gene himself. This leads the effusively smiling leader of the emoji to lobby for Gene¡¯s deletion from the phone on which he lives.The rationalization this movie uses for the anthropomorphization of the emoji is weak, to put it mildly. But once that has been taken care of, Gene goes on his hero¡¯s quest in search of the cloud, where he seeks to be reprogrammed so he can do the job he takes so much pride in. He of course has a bumbling sidekick (a high-five emoji) in tow. They enlist the help of the hacker Jailbreak and move through the corridors of their phone. Much labored app humor follows. For a long time, Hollywood has been propagating the idea that the panderingly, trendily idiotic can be made to seem less so, by polishing it up with bright shiny gloss and enlisting engaging talented performers and writers. I can¡¯t be entirely certain of this, but I would say ¡°The Emoji Movie¡± takes this notion to the outer limits of credibility. The voice cast is full of name actors, some of whom have genuine appeal. One of the screenwriters is the very astute Mike White. This movie¡¯s ¡°believe in yourself¡± message is borne out, in a perverse way, by the very fact that it even exists. And yet the whole thing remains nakedly idiotic.

"417","The Exception","2017-06-02","2017-06-01","http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/movies/the-exception-review.html","R",0,"In recent years, some movies have reopened the World War II files ¡ª especially those parts dealing with the Nazi occupation of Europe and the resistance to it ¡ª in search of gray areas and moral puzzles rather than black-and-white tales of treachery and heroism. ¡°The Exception,¡± a new film based on a novel by Alan Judd, circles back to an older tradition. Apart from the swearing, the nudity and the nonmarital sex, it¡¯s the kind of suspenseful, romantic melodrama of awakened conscience that might have been made in Hollywood or Britain in the early years of the war, before the worst of its horrors were widely known.Those horrors are foreshadowed, of course. During a dinner party, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS (repeatedly identified for the benefit of the unschooled modern audience and played with lurid understatement by Eddie Marsan), halts conversation with an account of new mass-killing techniques currently in the R&D phase. His hosts, the exiled German Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer) and his wife (Janet McTeer), are put in an awkward position, since they had hoped that their guest would be their ticket back to power. The Kaiser, a salty eccentric and a vocal anti-Semite ¡ª though hardly a vulgar, genocidal fanatic like Himmler ¡ª is languishing in a grand house in the Dutch countryside, having left his throne in Berlin after his country¡¯s humiliation in the previous world war. He receives daily briefings on military strategy (from a loyal aide played by Ben Daniels) and likes to show visitors his collection of military uniforms. The Empress runs the household with Prussian rigor and dreams of a restoration. Her husband makes some show of sharing her fantasy but seems to prefer splitting logs, feeding the ducks and flirting with a pretty young maid named Mieke (Lily James). She turns out to be a Jewish anti-Nazi partisan, and to complicate matters further she is the lover of Captain Brandt (Jai Courtney), a German officer in charge of guarding (and spying on) the Kaiser. The relationship between Mieke and Brandt, which begins with a smoldering exchange of glances and moves quickly from there, is the center of the film¡¯s intrigue. Is she entrapping him? Is he exploiting her? Are they good-looking people with libidos inflamed by wartime? All of the above?These questions matter for the plot, and for the themes that the movie, efficiently directed by David Leveaux from a screenplay by Simon Burke, wants to explore. Mieke has already suffered at the hands of the Nazis. Brandt, with shrapnel under his skin and nightmares in his head, has too. As a German patriot he is conscious of his duty and troubled by the extremism of Hitler and the SS. He detests the local SS heavy (Mark Dexter), a sadistic and humorless true believer. Brandt thinks that atrocities like the one he witnessed during combat in Poland are aberrations and that the German state and the German military are fundamentally honorable and decent. Mieke, seeing that he possesses those qualities, tries to convince him of his error. ¡°They are the rule,¡± she says. ¡°You are the exception.¡± That is a stirring sentiment, and ¡°The Exception¡± is a diverting and occasionally exciting film, though it is rarely disturbing or thought-provoking in ways the material might require. Mieke and Brandt, for all their sex and skulduggery, are less interesting than the Kaiser himself, a marginal player in this historical drama who nonetheless upstages everyone else. This is partly because Mr. Plummer, at this stage in his career, takes evident delight in the flourishes and extravagances that seniority affords. His Kaiser is full of mischief and vanity, in many ways a reprehensible figure but nonetheless able to charm his way out of the contempt he deserves. He might also have deserved a tougher, riskier, more robust movie, but on the evidence here he seems to have made the most of disappointment.",0.543280082266829,"Drama"

The miniskirts will be shorter, the toys zoomier, the stunts more delirious. Yet, like every successful series, this one delivers its sleek new bits and pieces in reassuringly familiar packaging. James Bond has queen and country. Vin Diesel¡¯s Dominic Toretto ¡ª the monotonal ¡°Fast and Furious¡± paterfamilias ¡ª has cars and camaraderie, an ideal combo for movies about American outsiders whose home has always been one another. Family is the most important word in these movies, the one that¡¯s dropped with moist emotion and hushed Sunday-sermon reverence. It¡¯s the idea that has held the franchise together ¡ª movie to movie, race to race, prayer to prayer ¡ª in an episodic soap about kith, kin and custom cars. It¡¯s what connects this franchise to its fans, another kind of family, though one that pays to sit down at the table. It¡¯s what has always bound Dom to his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and the rest of his crew, most crucially Brian, the cop-turned-soul-partner played by Paul Walker, who died in an off-set car collision in 2013.The new movie¡¯s title, ¡°The Fate of the Furious,¡± seems like a nod to the lingering existential crisis created by Mr. Walker¡¯s death, as do the tears that fall in the story. They¡¯re shed over time but before they are, the movie does what¡¯s expected, which is cut loose attractive characters in different choreographed formations in assorted machines and locales. Directed by F. Gary Gray (¡°Straight Outta Compton¡±), this one opens in Havana, where the young local beauties swirling around Dom and Letty move and dress more or less like the other young beauties in the series, as if they were part of a continuing global house party, this time with Che Guevara and prettily peeling buildings. Mr. Gray, an action-movie veteran, gets that party started quickly. Dom and Letty are hanging out in the new Havana, which in this case means chatting in Spanish and English while checking out a vintage car with a boat motor under the hood. It¡¯s a nice emblem of the movie¡¯s old-school opener, which involves some macho posturing that leads to Dom racing in a rusted-out beater. As he drives, ripping past one classic American car after another, he clutches the wheel, the camera pointing up at him. Like a supermodel¡¯s long legs, Mr. Diesel¡¯s sculptured, often-bared arms are one of his trademarks, and they do a lot of work, signifying strength and command. Here, though, they shudder. Both the old cars and Dom¡¯s unsteadiness set up a movie that clearly still needs to contend with Mr. Walker¡¯s death even as it delivers the goods. To that end, the filmmakers quickly isolate Dom from his crew (Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, et al.) and give him a proxy heartbreak. Elsewhere, the franchise¡¯s increasingly most valuable players, Dwayne Johnson and the bouncy Jason Statham, take care of business, going hard and funny. Kurt Russell shows up as a man in black with a newbie played by Scott Eastwood, whose resemblance to Big Daddy Clint adds intertextual genre frisson. Charlize Theron slinks in as a villainous hacker in silly blond dreads, jetting around while doing a lot of fast, furious typing.Punctuated by crashes and drums of doom, the movie moves to a dependable blockbuster beat, as a little exposition is followed by an action scene, and more exposition is followed by a bigger, noisier, nuttier action scene. As the cars zig and the story line zags, these sequences grow baroque, defying reason and gravity, which have progressively come under siege in this franchise. In New York, cars swan-dive off buildings or cut corners like rampaging dogs or, outfitted with Bond-like gizmos, harpoon a bucking ride. There¡¯s an odd Melville thing going on here: In a Bond-esque battle in Russia that typifies the franchise¡¯s expanded reach, a submarine breaches like Moby-Dick.Zoom, crash, repeat with squealing, burning and flaming tires ¡ª it¡¯s all predictably absurd and self-mocking, and often a giggle when not a total yawn. The tedium that sets in is a function of the blockbuster ethos in which everything must smash and ignite so that a solitary man can emerge phoenix-like to fight another franchise fight. Yet while Dom endures baptisms of fire, he is never genuinely alone. Part of the draw of the ¡°Fast and Furious¡± movies has always been their multicultural cast, but the series¡¯ strength is a utopian communitarianism that insists the group must be greater than any one man or nation. That¡¯s why Dom will only ever be the franchise¡¯s co-pilot; it¡¯s the crew that rules.",0.971771982342306,"Action"

His kinetic performance doesn¡¯t enhance the movie; it is the movie.The real Ray Kroc (1902-1984), as business-school students and more than a few fast-food consumers might know, is the entrepreneur who put the big numbers on the McDonald¡¯s sign. In the 1950s, that number was a lowly one million, but has since been replaced by the unfathomable, somewhat terrifying ¡°billions and billions.¡± Kroc liked to call himself the founder of McDonald¡¯s. His memoir, ¡°Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald¡¯s,¡± promises that it is ¡°The personal story behind founder Ray Kroc¡¯s amazing success!¡± Some of that sentence is true; the success part is, at any rate. Certainly it was a McGreat success, though one larded with McFibs.A cautious revisionist job, ¡°The Founder¡± tells an old-fashioned sweet-and-sour fable of good American capitalism versus bad, and how Ray Kroc built his fortune by steamrolling Mac and Dick McDonald ¡ª the brothers who built the first McDonald¡¯s ¡ª before going in for the corporate kill. History has at times portrayed these brothers as na<U+00EF>ve, almost as patsies. ¡°The Founder,¡± by contrast, suggests that the McDonalds weren¡¯t remotely rapacious enough to fend him off. They¡¯re proud and satisfied by what they¡¯ve built and the warm, mournful performances of Nick Offerman as Dick and the invaluable John Carroll Lynch as Mac are arguments for decency. (That¡¯s nice, but this is still all about Ray.) ¡°The Founder¡± opens in 1954 with Ray racking up miles selling milkshake mixers. He has his pitch down cold, but the customers aren¡¯t buying. His fortunes change when he comes across a bustling burger joint in San Bernardino, Calif., called McDonald¡¯s, where crowds of smiling customers sail through fast-moving lines. He¡¯s impressed by the turnout, but he¡¯s more taken with the seamless efficiency of the McDonalds¡¯ Speedee Service System. The brothers bring Ray into their business, showing him how it¡¯s done, not realizing that they¡¯ve invited a snake into their garden. Mr. Keaton nearly levitates off the floor in moments like this, creating a contact high. The director, John Lee Hancock, keeps things overly neat and tidy (it all shines or gleams), but he also keeps the story humming even when business talk threatens to slow it down. Like Ray, he seems lifted by the McDonalds, and there¡¯s real heart and pleasure in a flashback  in which they figure out their system¡¯s choreography, moving young, confused workers around like chess pieces. The McDonalds¡¯ introduction of Fordism to their business turned employees into factory workers and changed the restaurant industry, though the movie elides the global stakes. Mostly, it sticks to milestones and showdowns up until the handshake deal that changed everything.Mr. Hancock tends toward needless fussiness, overshooting and overcutting when he should let the camera run. (I lost count of all the angles he uses to show Ray reading a map.) That¡¯s too bad because some of the movie¡¯s best moments involve Ray alone, including a scene in which ¡ª in boxer shorts, a bottle nearby ¡ª he drops the needle on a motivational record. As an actor, Mr. Keaton often comes across as jittery as a thoroughbred at the gate, so when he goes still it feels as if something important is happening. Ray remains an unanswered, not especially compelling, question, but Mr. Keaton comes close to making you believe there¡¯s soul to go with the fries and freneticism.As Ray¡¯s ambition grows, he also grows more self-interested, adapting a purely instrumental approach to other people that seeps into his home life. One truism about great-man movies is that you can¡¯t have one without a nagging or a loving wife. Ray has both. Laura Dern plays Ethel the nag, the starter wife who enters frown first. Ms. Dern does what she can with bad lighting, drab surroundings and an underconceived character. As Joan, Ray¡¯s third wife, Linda Cardellini fares better. For one thing, she gets to smile (she lights up the room and Ray), wears pretty clothes and enjoys the fruits of his achievements. (The second Mrs. Kroc, Jane Dobbins Green, remains M.I.A.)Filmmakers used to polish up a halo to tell a great man¡¯s story; now they tend to carefully complicate the picture, underscoring his weaknesses and vices, boozing and philandering. Even with a few pins stuck in him, the great man remains great and very much the charismatic, triumphant individual. That¡¯s true of Ray, too, who for all his bad deeds never comes across as a true heavy. Mr. Keaton is good company, for one, and villainy just doesn¡¯t work in entertainments like this, which can¡¯t risk turning us off. Happily, there are always lawyers, in this case, Harry J. Sonneborn (B. J. Novak), who slithers up to Ray to explain where the money is. All Ray does is follow it.",0.994070108434164,"Biography"

The main object of that ambivalence is Rex Walls, a big-talking, big-dreaming ne¡¯er-do-well played with the usual guile and gusto by Woody Harrelson.Rex would qualify as a helicopter parent if that phrase referred to someone who encouraged his kid to pilot a chopper without proper training or safety equipment. If he and his wife, Rose Mary (Naomi Watts), don¡¯t go quite that far, it may only be for lack of available aircraft. Their four children are, to use another slightly anachronistic idiom in reference to a story set mostly in the ¡¯60s and ¡¯70s, decidedly free range. At a swimming pool, Rex throws Jeannette, his second-oldest daughter, into deep water to teach her to swim. That¡¯s hardly the craziest thing he does, but it¡¯s a convenient metaphor for his approach to parenting.Jeannette, played in middle childhood by a wonderfully shrewd and watchful young actress named Ella Anderson, will grow up to be played by Brie Larson and to grapple with adulthood in late-¡¯80s New York, where she writes a gossip column. Eventually, she¡¯ll also write a best-selling memoir of her hectic childhood, which has now been adapted into this uneven, conscientious film, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and written by Mr. Cretton and Andrew Lanham.Lacking the book¡¯s episodic sprawl and psychological nuance, their movie clings to its essential tension. Jeannette, her father¡¯s favorite ¡ª his nickname for her is Mountain Goat ¡ª admires her parents¡¯ free-spirited individualism even as she suffers amid the chaos of their chosen way of life. Money is always short, and the family often picks up and moves, one step ahead of bill collectors or law enforcement. Rose Mary paints landscapes, still lifes and portraits, while Rex, bouncing from job to job, conjures fantastical, almost-practical projects, like the solar-powered mansion that gives the movie its title. The clan¡¯s nomadic period, which takes up roughly the first half of Ms. Walls¡¯s memoir, is truncated on screen, and the audience never gets a full dose of the paternal wanderlust that provides Jeannette¡¯s childhood with its thrills and terrors. We spend more time in Welch, W.Va., Rex¡¯s Appalachian hometown, to which he had vowed never to return. Once there, in the shadow of his sinister mother, Erma (Robin Bartlett), Rex starts drinking more and dreaming less. As his charm dissolves, he devolves from a mischievous daredevil into a ranting, tyrannical drunk.Meanwhile, in the film¡¯s back-and-forth time scheme, adult Jeannette tries to find a place for her past (and her parents, who are now squatting on Manhattan¡¯s pre-gentrified Lower East Side) in her polished, professional existence. What this mostly means is trying to reconcile her attachment to Rex with her engagement to David, a sacrificial yuppie played by Max Greenfield. He¡¯s not a bad guy, he just cares about money, material possessions and what other people think. All of that makes him, somewhat too obviously, Rex¡¯s opposite.While Jeannette¡¯s attempt to deal with the men in her life provides ¡°The Glass Castle¡± with a bit of drama (and some comic scenes as well), it¡¯s frustrating to see the resourceful Ms. Larson pinioned between two showy male performers. Jeannette, the central voice and consciousness in the book, is an oddly blurred character on screen. And the film itself loses focus as it drifts toward the conventions of the coming-of-age story and the family-dysfunction melodrama.Conformity wins out in the end. Not that Rex ¡ª or the indefatigable Mr. Harrelson ¡ª is ever really tamed. But Mr. Lanham and Mr. Cretton, who proved himself a sensitive, risk-taking filmmaker with ¡°Short Term 12¡± (also starring Ms. Larson), couldn¡¯t find a way to contain both the father¡¯s anarchy and the daughter¡¯s skeptical affection for him. The movie bogs down in dialogue-heavy obvious scenes, some of which refer to events in the book that didn¡¯t make it onto the screen. It¡¯s both too tidy and too messy, and at the same time neither quite wild nor quite sensible enough.",0.51569799420214,"Biography"

It is in these mundane moments that the director and writer Paul Shoulberg finds a story.Father Daniel (Zachary Spicer) is a young priest who looks like a model from a 1950s Catholic schoolbook ¡ª right down to his sweater vest collection and perfectly parted hair. He works under the elder Father Victor (Danny Glover), a by-the-book priest, and Father Ollie (John C. McGinley), a sports-obsessed Franciscan priest, in a Midwestern college town. During a confessional shift, Father Daniel listens to the problems of a coffee shop singer-songwriter, Jane (Wrenn Schmidt), and offers her friendship instead of a penance.¡°The Good Catholic¡± is almost as strait-laced as its protagonist. As Jane develops a crush on Daniel, the movie starts to follow a conventional path. Her character, given little screen time to match Daniel¡¯s soul-searching, is most wanting. Some of Mr. Shoulberg¡¯s directorial decisions ¡ª actors¡¯ eyes drifting offscreen at an invisible audience ¡ª look theatrical rather than cinematic.Fortunately, Mr. Spicer¡¯s earnest performance bolsters many of the weaker spots in Mr. Shoulberg¡¯s script. The conflicting dynamics among the three men of the cloth provide most of the movie¡¯s punch lines.

Set once upon a time, the movie spins a legend that never was: Every 60 years, slavering creatures emerge from beyond to sharpen their teeth on human bones and stuff their bellies on meat. The whole thing plays out as if it had been thought up by someone who, while watching ¡°Game of Thrones¡± and smoking a bowl, started riffing on walls, China and production money.The threadbare story turns on a swaggering mercenary, William (Mr. Damon), who¡¯s trying to find what he calls ¡°black powder,¡± a.k.a. gunpowder. He and a sidekick, Tovar (Pedro Pascal, from ¡°Game of Thrones¡±), end up at the Great Wall, where after some macho posturing and chest thumping, they join forces with the wall¡¯s guardians, including an English-speaking military genius, Lin Mae (Jing Tian); an adviser, Wang (Andy Lau); and an assortment of supporting glowerers (Hanyu Zhang, Eddie Peng Yu-Yen and Ling Gengxin). Willem Dafoe, the whites of his eyes shining, is there, too, slinking around as Ballard, a Western prisoner who long ago also sought the black powder. That¡¯s about it, plus striking locations (the Rainbow Mountains), digital wizardry and battles between hordes of critters (called Tao Tei) and legions of soldiers. These are distinguished by skill and hue, like the blue-clad Crane Corp, who bungee-jump off the wall with spears. Outside of the bromantic quipping between William and Tovar, the dialogue is aggressively simple (no frills, no poetry) and skews along the lines of ¡°Release the Kraken¡± or, in this case, bring out the flaming balls of death and so forth. This seems to suit the director, Zhang Yimou (¡°Hero¡±), who lavishes much of his attention on the wall, which amusingly suggests a giant Swiss Army knife, scissors included. Mr. Damon, wearing hair extensions and employing an on-and-off Irish accent, looks uncharacteristically ill at ease during much of this. He may be the headliner, but he¡¯s also just one of this movie¡¯s many, many whirring parts. ¡°The Great Wall¡± flirts with romance and bleats out a little propagandistic blather about the benefits of bilateral action, but the focus throughout remains on multitudes of shifting, surging bodies ¡ª human and beast, digital and not ¡ª that, as they ebb and flow, resemble a Chinese military pageant and a lavish Busby Berkeley number. At times the effect brings to mind the German theorist  Siegfried Kracauer¡¯s ideas about Berkeley-like revues or, as he wrote in 1927, ¡°indissoluble girl clusters whose movements are demonstrations of mathematics.¡±In such formations, bodies are abstracted into larger geometric shapes and people transform into a collective mass ornament. This transformation obviously takes on sinister meaning when such formations are adapted for, say, Nazi propaganda, as demonstrated in the film ¡° Triumph of the Will.¡±In ¡°The Great Wall,¡± though, the bodies are divided into two distinct, oppositional configurations: the raw and the cooked. On the one side are the monsters that ¡ª despite being nicely designed zeros and ones ¡ª suggest a wildness that cannot be denied.

Barnum remains firmly lodged in the public imagination because of his gift for blurring the line between truth and fiction. When he presented the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington as a star attraction, some of his audience knew she was phony, others did not, and then there were those who did not care and went along for the ride. There¡¯s pleasure in a good fib (spoiler alert: Santa), as well as political advantage. When compared to Barnum last year, Donald Trump responded: ¡°We need P.T. Barnum, a little bit.¡±¡°The Greatest Showman,¡± a montage sequence that occasionally turns into a movie musical, steers clear of any contemporary resonance and ignores meaty themes. The first-time director Michael Gracey achieves an aggressively synthetic style through kinetic editing and tidy underdog stories, but none of the true joy of pulling a fast one. It¡¯s a standard-issue holiday biopic, one that tells a story about a populist entertainer hungry for highbrow respect, the joys of showbiz and the price of ambition. An amusement park version of P.T. Barnum is fine, as far as that goes, but if you are going to aim for family-friendly fun, you need to get the fun part right.¡°Showman¡± has the ingredients of a splashy good time, since it has the perfect star in Hugh Jackman, the most charismatic Broadway leading man of his generation; and songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the acclaimed duo behind the lyrics for last year¡¯s hit movie ¡°La La Land¡± (which won them Oscars) and the music for the Broadway show ¡°Dear Evan Hansen¡± (which won them Tonys). But they are all awkward fits for this material. The songs, which shift from defiant pop anthems to melodramatic ballads, do not evoke the circus, or at least not the American version. Their soupy soulfulness belongs to Cirque du Soleil more than Ringling Brothers. And while Mr. Jackman is a dashing presence with an easy smile, his earnest performance could use a few knowing winks. The script doesn¡¯t do him any favors. Its first joke is a spit-take, and it doesn¡¯t get any wittier than that. Not much time is wasted on Barnum¡¯s early life. Success comes quick, soon after making his American Museum, which mixes flea circuses and bearded ladies. Then Barnum starts chasing respectability, hiring an upper-crust playwright (a colorless Zac Efron), who falls in love with an acrobat (Zendaya), and presenting on tour the opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson). His star attractions turn into a kind of chorus of eccentrics, with minimal back stories.Playing the role of a skeptical theater critic as the joyless foil to the giddy fun inspired by Barnum, Paul Sparks maintains a stern deadpan, the way reviewers in movies do. As Barnum¡¯s wife, Charity, Michelle Williams gazes adoringly, until rumors in the press of his affair with Ms. Lind prompt her eyelids to fall in disappointment.The repercussions of this domestic drama are predictable, but at least they do lead to a delightful redemptive scene (one of the movie¡¯s few pleasingly dreamlike moments), when Barnum uses an elephant as a New York taxi to make an appointment on time. It¡¯s utter nonsense ¡ª imagine finding a parking space ¡ª but that¡¯s exactly what a movie about the self-proclaimed ¡°Prince of Humbugs¡± needs.",0.209168773105543,"Biography"

I know better than to take it personally when this kind of thing happens, but I do often wonder why it does happen. Usually the studio (Warner Bros. in this case) thinks it has a turkey on its hands, but sometimes it doesn¡¯t know quite what it has, and sneaks an interesting movie into theaters more or less by mistake. That seems to have been the case this time.Based on trailers and the durable, slightly stale charm of its stars, ¡°The House¡± might be mistaken for a genial, silly movie about nice people making questionable decisions. Instead, it is a dark, startlingly bloody journey into the bitter, empty, broken heart of the American middle class, a blend of farce and satire built on a foundation of social despair.It all starts innocently enough. Scott and Kate Johansen (Mr. Ferrell and Ms. Poehler) are visiting Bucknell University with their daughter, Alex (Ryan Simpkins). Mom and Dad are lovey, clingy, goofy Gen-X parents, and their kid is a high-achieving, deadpan millennial. Some borderline-inappropriate jokes are cracked and you brace yourself for 90 more minutes of semi-awkward, underwritten, marshmallow-soft humor featuring people who have been funnier elsewhere. But then Alex loses her scholarship and her parents face a not-all-that-exaggerated version of the struggle that confronts so many families. ¡°It¡¯s $50 million!¡± Scott exclaims when he sees the tuition bill. The poor math skills that seemed at first like an arbitrary character trait were more likely invented to enable that very joke. It might as well be $50 million. Suddenly this couple, with a big house in a pleasant, generic suburban town, find themselves in a state of abject desperation. So they team up with their pal Frank (Jason Mantzoukas) whose gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage and his self-esteem. He hopes to win back his estranged wife, Raina (Michaela Watkins) and persuades Scott and Kate to open an illegal casino in his half-empty mini-mansion. The business plan is straightforward: The house always wins.If ¡°The House¡± had been made in the ¡¯70s, it would have reveled in the grimness of the Johansens¡¯ circumstances and exploited the moral tawdriness of their response to it. What is most unnerving about the way their story is presented here ¡ª Andrew Jay Cohen directed, and wrote the script with Brendan O¡¯Brien ¡ª is the absence of that kind of dramatic intensity. Scott and Kate do some terrible things, and induce their friends and neighbors to misbehave in sometimes frightening ways. Scott mutilates someone with an ax. More than one person, actually. In addition to blackjack and roulette, the casino features an occasional fight club, in which upstanding folks pair off and beat each other bloody as their fellow burghers wager money on the outcome.The thing that will dismay some tenderhearted viewers ¡ª and that may have spooked the distributor ¡ª is the film¡¯s steely refusal of hypocrisy. You wait for the moment of comeuppance or redemption, for the restoration of right and wrong, but no such moment arrives. The pop-culture references and musical cues that pepper the action are not as ironic as they may seem. Scenes from ¡°The Walking Dead¡± and snatches of Snoop Dogg¡¯s ¡°Gz and Hustlas¡± and the ¡°Sopranos¡± theme song provide clues about the reality that Kate and Scott are only partly aware they inhabit.The town¡¯s political leadership (represented by Nick Kroll) is greedy and corrupt. Law enforcement (represented by Rob Huebel) is stupid and belligerent. The casino becomes not only a place of recreation but also the only place where civic interactions among the citizens seem possible. It also reveals the true face of a society divided into predators and prey, the house and the suckers. The only way to protect yourself and the people you love is to pick the right side. That seems shockingly cynical, but there is something admirable in a movie that examines some of the worst aspects of modern American life with blunt, good-humored honesty. We¡¯re not nice people.

It¡¯s silly without being truly strange or crossing over into absurdity. Along the way it pulls off a nifty balancing act: It gives the PG audience its own Batman movie (it¡¯s a superhero starter kit) and takes swipes at the subgenre, mostly by gently mocking the seriousness that has become a deadening Warner Bros. default. ¡°The Lego Batman Movie¡± can¡¯t atone for a movie as grindingly bad as the studio¡¯s ¡°Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,¡± which stars Ben Affleck as the Gotham City brooder, but at least someone on that lot gets the joke.The cast and crew of ¡°The Lego Batman Movie¡± sustain that joke admirably, filling in its 104-minute running time with loads of busy action, deadpan humor, visual comedy, reflexive bits and an overfamiliar story line. It features the usual cavalcade of marquee-ready talent (Rosario Dawson, Conan O¡¯Brien, Mariah Carey), the comic and less so, but owes much of its pleasure and juice to Will Arnett, who voices Batman. The movie puts a goofy spin on the Batman saga, but it squeezes its brightest, most sustained comedy from Mr. Arnett¡¯s hypnotically sepulchral voice, which conveys the entire bat ethos ¡ª the Sturm und Drang, the darkness and aloneness, the resoluteness and echoiness ¡ª in vocal terms. It¡¯s blissfully self-serious, near-Wagnerian and demented. Mr. Arnett anchors the movie, though he¡¯s nicely book-ended by Michael Cera, as the excitable pip-squeaker Dick Grayson, and Ralph Fiennes, who voices Alfred, Bruce Wayne¡¯s trusted butler and operational aide-de-camp. Some of the wittiest moments happen early, before the story machinery starts humming, and involve Batman-Bruce wandering his mansion in his fetishlike mask and a silky red bathrobe, nuking his lobster dinner and giggling solo at ¡°Jerry Maguire.¡± If Christopher Nolan¡¯s ¡°Dark Knight¡± cycle suggests that Batman teeters on actual madness, ¡°The Lego Batman Movie¡± ups the ante by insinuating that he has fully settled into near-Howard Hughes eccentricity. Not too much nuttiness, mind you, just enough to keep the jokes pinging and zinging, at least until the story amps up. Most of that involves the Joker (Zach Galifianakis), who¡¯s not the transgressive opposition but a whining smiler desperately yearning for Batman¡¯s attention. This isn¡¯t as funny or engaging as the filmmakers seem to think, partly because a child-friendly Joker can¡¯t have the scariness or anarchic threat that distinguishes this character¡¯s better iterations. (He can¡¯t compete partly because he¡¯s nowhere near as loopy as this Batman.) Mostly, the Joker is the master of ceremonies for the rest of the villainous horde, a motley crew of creatures that includes Harley Quinn (Jenny Slate), who¡¯s mostly a trauma trigger for ¡°Suicide Squad,¡± another supersplat.As an object, ¡°The Lego Batman Movie¡± looks as good as its predecessor, ¡°The Lego Movie.¡± This one is similarly shiny and bright, though sometimes as teasingly dark as Batman. Even when the story drags, which it does as the action grows frenetic, the shiny and bright bits catch the eye. As in the first movie, the character design does much of the most meaningful work because it conveys part of what¡¯s enjoyable about Legos, including their smooth-to-the-touch plastic surfaces and knobby bits (studs in Lego lingo), which you can almost feel in your hands as you watch. One of the satisfactions of Legos is their touch sensation, a sense memory that¡¯s imprinted on brains, too. Basing movies on kiddie playthings is ingenious: It turns every Lego brick into a Rosebud sled, a portal into childhood. That makes resistance fairly futile, or at least tough, especially when the crew ushering you into the past is up to the task, as is the case here. Chris McKay directed this one, working from a jammed script by Seth Grahame-Smith, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Jared Stern and John Whittington. (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who directed ¡°The Lego Movie,¡± helped produce ¡°The Lego Batman Movie.¡±) The whole vibe is, as the first ¡°Lego¡± movie insisted with its deliriously catchy anthem, awesome, so, relax, enjoy the show, go with the flow. I mean, who hates Legos? Isn¡¯t that like hating childhood?Well, of course not, though that gets to what¡¯s frustrating about these movies, which are so insistently good-natured and relentlessly hyped that it feels almost churlishly old-school raising even modest objections to the fact that ¡ª in addition to being, you know, fun ¡ª they¡¯re also commercials. It¡¯s not new or news that movies have long sold stuff, including studio tie-ins and toys, as Walt Disney explained by example decades ago, though, like Pixar, he was also in the business of storytelling and not merely corporate-brand storytelling and building. Certainly there are worse things in life and definitely worse movies, including the ¡°Transformers¡± blockbusters, which sell both toys and war. So, as far as commercials go, ¡°The Lego Batman Movie¡± is just swell. But because its primary function, outside of making bank, is to extend two brands ¡ª Lego and Batman ¡ª it can¡¯t help but disappoint. One reason that the first ¡°Lego¡± movie worked as well as it did is that its novelty and trippier moments conveyed a sense of play and unboundedness, which is part of the appeal of Legos themselves. (It¡¯s the better movie and ad.) The Batman story, by contrast, proves to be a prison, one its creators never escape.

His estranged teenage son, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is ostracized and mocked for being the child of such a monster. But Lloyd, whose alter ego is the Green Ninja, works behind the scenes to check his father¡¯s worst tendencies. Does every movie have to be a political allegory now?

Centering on three irreverent nuns played by Aubrey Plaza (witchy and bitchy), Alison Brie (frustrated and snooty) and Kate Micucci (bi-curious and babyish), the goofy plot never finds its groove.

Enveloped by the forest, the explorer and his crew face snakes, piranhas, insects and that most terrifying of threats: other people, who at times bombard the strangers with arrows. Undaunted, he perseveres, venturing more deeply into a world that first becomes a passion and then something of a private hallucination. It¡¯s 1906, and while wonders like moving pictures are rapidly shrinking the world, the dream of unknown lands endures.That dream isn¡¯t only about the Amazon in ¡°The Lost City of Z¡± but also about the movies and their ability to transport us to astonishing new worlds. For us, the Age of Discovery is long gone and, for the most part, so are old-fashioned historical epics, other than the occasional Chinese extravaganza or one of those international waxworks with clashing accents. Hollywood used to churn these out regularly, but they¡¯ve faded, casualties of shifting industry logic, audience taste, cultural norms and other pressures. The romance of adventure has largely shifted from history to fantasy fiction, an easier, less contested playground for conquering white heroes. In ¡°The Lost City of Z,¡± the writer-director James Gray has set out to make a film in the colonial era that suggests the likes of David Lean¡¯s ¡°Lawrence of Arabia,¡± but through a sensitive, contemporary lens. It¡¯s one that starts from the premise that while white men have long been the keepers of the historical record, they didn¡¯t make the past single-handedly. The story that Mr. Gray has chosen seems an unlikely candidate for such revisionism because it turns on Lieut. Col. Percy Harrison Fawcett, who came to believe in the existence of a lost Amazonian civilization. He called it the lost city of Z; others called it El Dorado, a European illusion that proved catastrophic for the New World. The movie opens shortly before Fawcett is approached by the Royal Geographical Society to map uncharted territory in Bolivia. A career soldier and son of a disgraced aristocrat, Fawcett is anxious to change his fortunes and increase his social standing. Leaving behind, rather too easily, his loving wife, Nina (Sienna Miller, wonderful), and their young son (later played by Tom Holland), he sets off and is soon struggling through the Amazon with a small crew that includes an aide-de-camp, Henry Costin (an excellent Robert Pattinson, shaggy and almost unrecognizable). Deep in a jungle, where each wonder is matched by terror, Fawcett is ravaged ¡ª and then transformed ¡ª by his discoveries of both a new world and another self. Mr. Gray opens this world gloriously. As a director, he has an old-fashioned belief in cinematic beauty, in the charm and necessity of the perfectly lighted and framed face, the hauntingly darkened room, the grittily coarsened street. He¡¯s a sensualist, and in ¡°The Lost City of Z¡± he turns the Amazon into a ravishment for the senses. (The cinematographer, Darius Khondji, who goes dark brilliantly, shot Mr. Gray¡¯s last film, ¡°The Immigrant.¡±) As Fawcett presses on, walking and sailing through dense shadow, streaming light and canopies of variegated green, the natural world comes fantastically alive with strange animal cries, stirring trees, roiling fog and frighteningly violent eddies.In time, native peoples emerge from those trees, by turns watchful, threatening and welcoming. Much as he does throughout his Amazonian travels, Fawcett is enlivened by his encounters with the Indians. He¡¯s a natural, somewhat surprisingly peaceful ambassador given his background and historical moment (even if his restraint also nicely suits Mr. Hunnam¡¯s slow-burning charisma). When his expedition comes under siege at one point, he orders his men not to fire and instead waves a kerchief while calling out ¡°Amigo!¡± It¡¯s a stratagem, but Fawcett¡¯s curiosity is boundless and he sees accomplishment and complexity in this world, which sharply goes against bigoted orthodoxies back home.Mr. Gray, working from David Grann¡¯s 2009 book, ¡°The Lost City of Z,¡± glosses over Fawcett¡¯s more noxious beliefs. Mr. Grann, for one, writes that Fawcett ¡°escaped virtually every kind of pathology in the jungle, but he could not rid himself of the pernicious disease of race.¡± It¡¯s no surprise that the real Fawcett was as fascinatingly contradictory as you might expect of a Victorian-born British explorer. Mr. Gray doesn¡¯t soften all of these uncomfortable edges ¡ª there is arrogance and tinges of cruelty in this portrait ¡ª but he¡¯s far more interested in what seems to have distinguished Fawcett, namely his passionate belief that Amazonian Indians were not the primitives the West insisted they were. That passion sends Fawcett back to the Amazon several more times over the years, eventually becoming a kind of steadily devouring fever. He¡¯s hailed as a hero after he returns from his first trip, but by the time he¡¯s home he has a new child, whose birth he missed. This sets the template for his life, as Fawcett increasingly gives himself over to the Amazon and neglects his family, a familiar divide that Mr. Gray turns into the story¡¯s axis point. In most movies of this type, the great man kisses the little woman goodbye and sets off. Here, partly because Fawcett repeatedly returns home, Nina emerges as a substantial narrative force and not only a reminder of what he¡¯s willing to sacrifice.Fawcett finds ecstasy in and out of the Amazon, as does Mr. Gray, who fills the screen with intimate reveries and overwhelming spectacle, including a harrowing interlude during World War I. Until now, Mr. Gray has tended to work on a somewhat modest scale, often with art films that play with genre. Here, he effortlessly expands his reach as he moves across time and continents and in the process turns the past into a singular life. There¡¯s much to love in this film, but what lingers are those lapidary details that often go missing in stories about great men, as if they had built the world alone and no child had ever raced down a road waving goodbye as a father disappeared into history.

Yet the extracurricular bonking that they gingerly enjoy ¡ª she with a needy writer (Aidan Gillen) and he with a neurotic ballet dancer (Melora Walters) ¡ª appears to bring only marginally more pleasure than their sclerotic union.Sadly, that¡¯s only one problem with this overdetermined, fussily managed romance. Falling with a thud between two stools, it has neither the zip nor the zaniness of farce nor the airy vivacity of the best romantic comedies. The sugary, violin-heavy score that elbows its way into virtually every scene might beg to differ, but its cudgeling chords can¡¯t force enchantment when, improbably, Mary and Michael¡¯s jaded passions are rekindled.That would require a screenplay (by the director, Azazel Jacobs) with sparkle and energy instead of one that takes forever to nudge characters from staring to kissing. No one suffers more from this programmatic approach than Ms. Winger, whose warm, loamy sexiness demands roaming privileges. Only watch her in ¡°The Sheltering Sky,¡± playing a dissatisfied wife who finds her true self in the middle of the desert. She¡¯s the beating heart of that movie, turning what could have been a sterile exercise in alienation and ennui into something vibrantly human.Which brings me to a third stool that Mr. Jacobs (who also directed and helped to write the smart, adorably prickly HBO series ¡°Doll & Em¡±) could have claimed. Beneath its mushy music, ¡°The Lovers¡± nurses something altogether more sour and more fruitful: a self-sabotaging desperation that you can sense Ms. Winger straining to vocalize.

The resonances begin with its title. ¡°The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)¡± takes a literary angle that indirectly suggests The New Yorker, J. D. Salinger and, to some extent, Woody Allen. Mr. Baumbach sticks with the short-story conceit throughout, but he uses it as both a guiding principle and a means to surprise.After the quiet opening credits (delivered in a terribly genteel typeface), the first line of the first story appears: ¡°Danny Meyerowitz was trying to park.¡± The movie cuts to a medium close-up of a mustachioed Adam Sandler at a steering wheel looking back over his shoulder and screaming his head off. This is good for a laugh (and there are more to come), but once Danny pulls out of the impossible space and tools around downtown Manhattan, a different side of the character appears. His daughter, Eliza (Grace Van Patten), has been peppering their parking adventure with some dietary advice for her father, which he shrugs off with good humor. When ¡°Head to Toe,¡± a 1987 hit by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam comes on the car¡¯s stereo, Danny and Eliza exchange warm reminiscences while singing along. While he may be prone to parking rage (as who isn¡¯t, but as it happens, he gets mad about lots of other stuff as well), Danny seems, overall, a great dad and a warm-hearted guy. But Danny¡¯s father, Harold, immediately establishes himself as a less-than-great patriarch when his son and granddaughter arrive for a visit ¡ª Eliza just for a night, as she¡¯s headed off to Bard; Danny for longer, as he¡¯s just separated from his wife. Played with spectacularly virtuosic timing and emotional misdirection by Dustin Hoffman, Harold is a sculptor feeling unappreciated late in life. This is a state he can¡¯t help commenting on repeatedly, talking over everyone around him: Danny, Eliza; his current wife and the world¡¯s worst cook, Maureen (Emma Thompson); his withdrawn daughter, Jean (Elizabeth Marvel); and later, his other son, Matthew (Ben Stiller), a successful business manager in Los Angeles whose own reluctant visit is extended by a series of mishaps.These characters have a lot to work out, and they do work it out, mostly hilariously. The Meyerowitzes are paragons of a specifically Manhattan-style liberal tolerance: The scene in which Danny and his sister and father react with complete nonchalance to Eliza¡¯s first student film, a self-starring quasi-pornographic fantasia about a superhero named ¡°Pagina-Man,¡± is likely to be cited in a good number of culture-conservative think pieces this season. None of the Meyerowitzes are fulfilled, and all of them seethe with resentment. Almost everything that comes out of Harold¡¯s mouth is a passive-aggressive accusation pitched with head-spinning atonal refinement, as when, on an unscheduled visit to the home of one of his ex-wives (Candice Bergen, in a droll cameo), he makes a beeline to a bookshelf and says ¡°I think this is my copy of ¡®Buddenbrooks.¡¯¡±With this film, Mr. Baumbach has achieved a near-perfect balance between engagement and discomfort. In ¡°The Squid and the Whale¡± and ¡°Margot at the Wedding,¡± something drove him to depict family squabbles with a candor that approached cruelty. The anger in those movies and some of his others was bracing, though a little more so than necessary. As boisterous and edgy as ¡°The Meyerowitz Stories¡± gets, it is a more mellow film, and to my eyes and ears all the better for it. As is customary in Mr. Baumbach¡¯s pictures, the acting is spectacular. Ms. Thompson is hilarious, Ms. Marvel applies her customary note-perfect execution of character, and Ms. Van Patten is what they call a find. And while Mr. Stiller¡¯s Matthew is both reliably and appealingly neurotic, it is Mr. Sandler who excels, both riotously and poignantly.Mr. Baumbach¡¯s fondness for his characters is such that as the movie passes its 90-minute mark, it becomes evident that he doesn¡¯t want it to end. This compels him to end it several more times than he needs to. My fondness for the characters had become such that I really did not mind.",0.946890774298767,"Comedy"

But despite her exemplary range, many American viewers maintain an image of her as an aloof, exquisite, possibly imperious, possibly enigmatic beauty. This is largely because she looks like, well, Catherine Deneuve. The woman can¡¯t help it. Even when portraying the needy, nearly shambolic B¨¦atrice in ¡°The Midwife,¡± Ms. Deneuve is capable of vibrating with an elegance that implies both hauteur and froideur.B¨¦atrice is not the title character of this film, written and directed by Martin Provost. That is Claire, played by Catherine Frot, a superb and prolific actress whose work in French cinema is not nearly as well known here as Ms. Deneuve¡¯s is. Claire is fantastic at her job: calm, expert, compassionate. She cares deeply about her work, which, as the movie opens, takes place at a birthing clinic that will soon be closing. She cares so deeply, for instance, that she keeps trying to resuscitate a stillborn baby, long after everyone else has faced reality, in one of the movie¡¯s many realistic medical scenes. (This one, in particular, was sufficiently convincing to arouse my terrified curiosity as to how it was achieved. The other childbirth scenes, and there are a fair number, also look authentic.)Claire¡¯s job appears to be the main focus of a tidy, organized, somewhat lonely life. A single mother, she has a son with whom she shares a tight bond, but he¡¯s approaching adulthood and getting ready to strike out on his own. On weekends, and after biking home from the clinic, she tends a garden in a shared plot of land. Her neighbor there, a friendly, salt-of-the-earth truck driver named Paul ¡ª played with simple amiability by Olivier Gourmet, the wonderful actor and good-luck charm for the Belgian filmmaker brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne ¡ª takes an immediate strong liking to Claire. But she¡¯s not terribly interested in making any human connections beyond those she has with the mothers she helps, and the babies she delivers.But then a voice from the past sends a tremor into her placid life. That would be Ms. Deneuve¡¯s B¨¦atrice, a former mistress of Claire¡¯s father (now dead), whose abandonment of both her lover and his daughter engendered heartbreak and worse 30 or so years earlier. Still trying to keep up appearances, despite being in a bad place, B¨¦atrice reaches out to Claire for the standard-issue movie melodrama reason: She¡¯s gravely ill (with a brain tumor) and is afraid of dying alone. Yet she won¡¯t alter her behavior, which includes a lot of smoking and drinking, some hard-core gambling and extravagant dining. Claire gives B¨¦atrice advice, refuses her proffered gifts and tries brushing her off, but of course she cannot. The tremor becomes something of a genuine seismic event for Claire.Because it is a French film, or rather the kind of French film that wants to serve its sentimentality with a dollop of prestige, ¡°The Midwife¡± doesn¡¯t offer an entirely shameless version of the ¡°dying free spirit imbues uptight caretaker with a new lust for life¡± scenario. It doesn¡¯t spoon-feed the viewer a lot of exposition, leaving parts of the back story a little enigmatic. It drops in peculiar little character touches, including one bizarre bit concerning the resemblance between Claire¡¯s son, Simon, and his dear departed grandfather.But it ends up where all of these movies do: spiritually (if you can call it that). Here the corporeal manifestation of the spiritual conclusion is three characters of a certain age in the cab of a moving 18-wheeler, smiling and singing along to Serge Reggiani. If there¡¯s an American remake of this, the singer will be Jim Croce.",0.919849556417892,"Drama"

I¡¯m not an Egyptologist, but it seems just as likely that those words were lifted from a movie-studio strategy memo. Universal, lacking a mighty superhero franchise, has gone into its intellectual-property files, which are full of venerable monsters, and created a commercial agglomeration it calls the Dark Universe. ¡°The Mummy¡± is the first of a slew ¡ª a swarm? a pestilence? ¡ª of features reviving those old creatures, including the one from the Black Lagoon.

Its agent is a long-buried pharaoh¡¯s daughter, Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who is covered with mysterious tattoos and convinced that Nick is her secret lover, or the god of death, or both. She gets inside his head, which is awkward both because he¡¯s kind of sweet on Jenny and because it¡¯s such an empty place. Ahmanet also has a retinue of zombielike minions at her disposal, who rampage through England on their way to a meeting with Russell Crowe. Mr. Crowe plays another fixture in the Dark Universe, a label that strikes me as a bit of an exaggeration. Dim Universe would be more accurate, with respect both to the murky, ugly images and to the intellectual capacities of the script, written and conceived by a bunch of people who are capable of better. The old black-and-white Universal horror movies were a mixed bag, but they had some imagination. They could be creepy or campy, weird or lyrical. ¡°The Mummy¡± gestures ¡ª or flails ¡ª in a number of directions but settles into the dreary 21st-century action-blockbuster template.

An otherwise highly competent director (in this case, Terry George) succumbs to the lure of addressing a real-life atrocity (here, the still-contested slaughter of more than a million peaceful Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I). Somewhere along the way, though, the need to do justice to the slain and call out the perpetrators becomes a pillow that smothers every spark of originality. Even actors with the heft of Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale ¡ª playing an Armenian apothecary named Mikael and an American war reporter named Chris ¡ª appear muffled and indistinct.This dimming extends to an excruciatingly corny plot that has both characters vie for the twinkling affections of Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), a Paris-educated, terminally cute tutor. But first Mikael must finagle a dowry to finance medical school in Constantinople, so he promises to marry Maral (Angela Sarafyan), a lovely innocent from his village. Once in the grip of the city and Ana¡¯s charms, however, Mikael is lost; the combined demands of a soggy love triangle and the approach of war soon banish all thoughts of marriage ¡ª to Maral, at least. Mikael, then, is not particularly sympathetic, and Chris is a humorless newshound; so when the jackboots tramp and the killing begins, their fates are of less concern than they should be.

As if apprised in advance of our current political moment, the director, Nancy Buirski, wields the titular violation as a signpost to a wider, more insidious American crime. In this way, the 1944 gang-rape of one black woman in Alabama becomes emblematic of the effacement of an entire gender.Were it not for the director¡¯s steady hand and adamantine focus on her destination, this ambition could have been the film¡¯s undoing. Instead, its scope is stirring, the gradual accumulation of insult and outrage reaching far beyond tiny Abbeville where the crime occurred and where Recy, then 24, lived with her husband and new daughter.

The president on horseback. ¡°Evil Empire.¡± ¡°Trust, but verify.¡± ¡°Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!¡±But for viewers seeking either to refresh their memories of, or to learn something new about, the 40th president, this documentary, directed by Sierra Pettengill and Pacho Velez and made up of ¡¯80s-vintage archival video, will prove puzzling and unsatisfying. It dwells, as people often did back then, on the remarkable fact that Reagan had been an actor in Hollywood, but it does not chronicle the path that took him from the movies to the California governor¡¯s mansion on his way to the White House.Nor does it deal with his campaigns, or with his role in the ideological transformation of American politics. Domestic policy is all but invisible. There is nothing about tax cuts, supply-side economics, the air traffic controllers¡¯ strike, AIDS or the Supreme Court. No Grenada, no El Salvador, no Lebanon. The Iran-contra scandal gets a bit of attention, but only as a sidebar to the film¡¯s main preoccupation, the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.That is a great and consequential story, of course, and focusing on it saves ¡°The Reagan Show¡± from triviality. The improbable diplomatic bromance between Reagan, an unbending anti-Communist, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the reform-minded general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, yielded many memorable moments on the public stage. Their negotiation of an arms treaty also provides a rare and encouraging example of successful peacemaking between rival countries. While thin on strategic or historical analysis, the film does provide a glimpse at the characters of the two leaders. Reagan himself, though, remains something of a cipher. What you see in these videos, many of them recorded as part of a novel administration initiative called ¡°White House TV,¡± is mostly what you might remember or expect. The president seems like an affable, charming man, at once comfortable in his own skin and oddly detached from his surroundings, with a ready supply of quips, quotations and anecdotes to defuse whatever tension or discomfort might be hovering in the air. If you were predisposed to hate him, you might be surprised to feel a twinge of affection. If you already admired him, you may want a more robust hagiography.But, in any case, you will have to go elsewhere to assess the consequences of his style of leadership, and of the movement he helped bring to power. There are many fine books, of course, and a brilliant essay by Joan Didion. The rhetorical questions posed by earnest talking heads of the era have been rendered moot by history, but Reagan¡¯s legacy remains a live and contentious issue.

Recent Hollywood movies like ¡°Moana¡± and ¡°Finding Dory¡± display glistening waves, plump raindrops and churning ocean depths with gaudy trade-show flash. ¡°The Red Turtle,¡± a feature by the Dutch animator Michael Dudok de Wit, hews to a quieter, proudly analog (or at least analog-evoking) approach. The waves that toss the nameless protagonist, a presumably shipwrecked fellow with black-dot eyes and an inky beard, are proudly two-dimensional, and look as if they had been rendered with a pen and a brush rather than a mouse and a software application.The film, a French-Belgian-Japanese co-production made under the auspices of Studio Ghibli  (home of the great Hayao Miyazaki) in Tokyo is also notable, at least in contrast to most American commercial animation, for the absence of celebrity voices or, indeed, of any human speech at all. The score, by Laurent Perez del Mar, does include some wordless choral vocalizing, but the story, like the visual style, is simple and elemental, like a picture book that needs no words. The story has a wide-eyed, mutedly whimsical charm, with a light washing of eco-mysticism. Some of what happens may, on reflection, seem a little disturbing. The hapless mariner washes ashore ¡ª as such sailors usually do ¡ª on a deserted island, a tropical, rock-capped outcropping with wide, sandy beaches flanking a dense bamboo forest. There is a freshwater lagoon, and a few animals around for company and food, including sea lions and a squadron of quizzical crabs that silently and collectively perform the necessary cute-cartoon-sidekick duties. The red sea turtle, an enigmatic and beautifully drawn creature that seems to have some kind of grudge against our hero, shows up just when you start to wonder if it will. Every time the man tries to leave the island, the turtle smashes his raft and knocks him back over the sandbar onto the beach. This leads to a confrontation that nudges the story all the way into the realm of fable. I won¡¯t say exactly what happens, except to note that it¡¯s both enchanting and a little queasy-making. But new characters do appear, fleshing out the drama and the imagery. Events take place that allow Mr. Dudok de Wit to make the most of his subdued palette and his spare, lyrical draftsmanship.¡°The Red Turtle¡± practices a minor, gentle magic.

There are cracks in the walls, and the high-rise building is in danger of collapsing. That flawed edifice might stand as a kind of inverse metaphor for the film itself, which is a marvel of meticulous construction. With exquisite patience and attention to detail, Asghar Farhadi, the writer and director, builds a solid and suspenseful plot out of ordinary incidents, and packs it with rich and resonant ideas.Admirers of his earlier films ¡ª including ¡°About Elly,¡± ¡°The Past¡± and ¡°A Separation,¡± a foreign-language Oscar winner in 2012 ¡ª will not be surprised. Mr. Farhadi has distinguished himself in his generation of Iranian filmmakers as an astute psychological realist and a fastidious storyteller. Although his films take place in a thoroughly modern, urban environment, there is something satisfyingly old-fashioned about his approach to contemporary life, an understated belief in the ethical value of addressing the complexities of experience through the clarity and subtlety of narrative art.[See where to stream Asghar Farhadi¡¯s dramas at Watching, The New York Times¡¯s film and TV recommendation site.] Rana and Emad, a childless married couple who look to be in their mid-30s, are both actors, members of a theater company engaged in a production of Arthur Miller¡¯s ¡°Death of a Salesman.¡± Onstage, they play the Lomans, Willy and Linda, whose lower-middle-class American world is made to look both familiar and exotic. Some of the play¡¯s sexual frankness has been blunted by Iranian government censors ¡ª in a pivotal scene, Willy¡¯s mistress shows up in his hotel room wearing a hat and a belted red raincoat, rather than a nightgown ¡ª and its themes of striving and sacrifice seem distant from Rana and Emad¡¯s life. Though they are not wealthy, the fact that they ¡°work in culture¡± gives them a certain cachet, and they sometimes radiate a quiet sense of superiority in interactions with neighbors and acquaintances. The ghost of Willy Loman nonetheless hovers over ¡°The Salesman,¡± suggesting an interpretive puzzle. The choice of this particular play-within-the-film can¡¯t be arbitrary, but its meaning is not immediately apparent. For most of its running time, the movie seems occupied with its own dramatic issues, principally the aftermath of a shocking and apparently inexplicable act of violence.The apartment that Emad and Rana move into ¡ª thanks to the generosity of a colleague ¡ª isn¡¯t actually haunted, but like many films about real estate ¡°The Salesman¡± is to some extent a horror movie. The previous tenant was a single woman with a young child, and the stuff she left behind is more than just annoying clutter. It¡¯s a collection of clues to an unacknowledged mystery, haunting traces of an invisible life.That life invades the couple¡¯s household with shocking force. Rana is assaulted in the shower, and her attacker vanishes, leaving behind his pickup truck. The crime reveals tensions and fissures within her marriage, and also beyond it. Rana, whose head was injured in the attack ¡ª other possible traumas are left implicit ¡ª is terrified and distraught, but Emad seems more concerned with the injury to his own manhood. The absence of the police suggests a lack of trust in official authority so complete that it is scarcely worth mentioning. Emad¡¯s search for answers, and for something like justice, turns him into a reluctant vigilante, and ¡°The Salesman¡± is unsparing in its portrayal of the moral emptiness of personal vengeance.It is in the midst of this painful tale of crime and punishment that the spirit of Willy Loman makes its improbable, powerful and surprisingly literal return. ¡°The Salesman¡± is about trust and honor, about violence against women in a patriarchal society, about the woe that is in marriage, but it is also about death, a salesman and the hidden brutality of class. Not since Pedro Almod¨®var¡¯s ¡°All About My Mother,¡± which brilliantly re-engineered ¡°A Streetcar Named Desire,¡± has a classic of the American stage been put to such ingenious cinematic use.

Whether the crime was a botched robbery or an episode of racially motivated violence is the subject of debate.

With names like Morning Glory, these crates promised a ray of sun in each juicy bite. In 1970, Florida anointed itself the Sunshine State, but this documentary suggests that way out West, where much of this acid was produced, was where the sun shone the brightest.For Nick Sand and Tim Scully, lysergic acid diethylamide was where it, really everything, was at. Both were in their 20s when they first experimented with psychedelics, an experience they say in the movie indelibly changed each for good and, some might say, bad. A California native, Mr. Scully had been studying at Berkeley before coming under the influence of Owsley Stanley, an intimate of the Grateful Dead and fervent advocate for acid. The more voluble Mr. Sand, a Brooklynite, entered the scene through Millbrook ¡ª the estate in upstate New York where Timothy Leary and friends partied for years ¡ª eventually going west. (In the early 1960s, Leary helped oversee the Harvard Psilocybin Project, researching LSD.) Whether together or apart, Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully seemed to be operating on a similar wavelength, and the movie gets a lot of mileage from their sometimes excellent, at times hair-raising, occasionally puckishly funny and altogether wild adventures. At least according to ¡°The Sunshine Makers,¡± theirs is the story of two young men who found and (arguably) lost their way in the ¡¯60s, a tale that has resonance for the bigger sociopolitical picture. Both Mr. Scully and Mr. Sand saw themselves as missionaries of a type, spreading transcendence one hit at a time. Mr. Sand says that during one early enlightened moment, a voice told him, ¡°Your job on this planet is to make psychedelics and turn on the world.¡± He obeyed that voice unconditionally. The director, Cosmo Feilding Mellen, fluidly knits together a lot of information, people and places, sights and sounds, including some faded, pretty far-out archival footage of Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully making acid in labs back in the day. (The editor Nick Packer deserves credit as well.) As Mr. Mellen plaits together these individual histories, he incessantly toggles between past and present. Some of the flashbacks to the ¡¯60s are as familiar as hippie chicks and the corner of Haight and Ashbury, but Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully are true individuals, with delightful quirks and weird tales that keep the material from genericism. (There are several scenes of Mr. Sand practicing yoga in the nude, a lifelong habit that he¡¯s continued into his 70s.)¡°The Sunshine Makers¡± isn¡¯t exactly an advocacy movie, but Mr. Mellen¡¯s sympathies are transparently with his subjects, even if he does check in (humorously and a touch condescendingly) with some of the cops who once chased down Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully. At times, it all seems a bit too, well, sunny, especially given what happened after Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully¡¯s production increased and their stacks of cash grew. (Another documentary, ¡°Orange Sunshine,¡± focuses on the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, which distributed their acid.)

These range from the menial (fixing her washing machine) to the potentially ruinous (smuggling a cake to Moscow by plane, which could cost a father who works at the airport his job). Ms. Maurery has great fun with the character, a tricky part because Maria nearly always maintains a kindhearted veneer, even at her most venal. It¡¯s clear she has no regard for her class¡¯s well-being or education.While somewhat on the nose as allegory, the movie deftly illustrates that a culture of collaboration ¡ª whether in Bratislava in the 1980s or, indeed, any political or workplace context ¡ª requires active participation, even if subconscious. When Maria backs down on the cake-smuggling request, Marek (Csongor Kassai), the airport accountant, is so relieved that he offers to drive her to her country cottage, seemingly oblivious that he¡¯s being pressed into a different kind of service. Most of what we see of Maria comes in flashbacks during a parents¡¯ conference the school¡¯s head teacher (Ina Gogalova) has convened, risking her own job because Maria is the chair of the Communist Party at the school. But if enough parents sign a formal complaint, they may be able to oust her.There are shades of ¡°12 Angry Men¡± in the scenes of the parents trying to convince one another to sign it. Contrary to the idea that strength comes in numbers, ¡°The Teacher¡± illustrates that some of the parents, while individually upset, are afraid to speak up as a group. They¡¯ve already bought into a corrupt system, acceding to the teacher¡¯s demands, and signing the petition is tantamount to an admission of guilt.Like Mr. Hrebejk¡¯s ¡°Divided We Fall¡± ¡ª a story of a sheepish Czech gentile who locates a vein of courage and generosity during the Nazi occupation ¡ª ¡°The Teacher¡± is polished, engaging and somewhat risk-averse.

That way, the therapeutic calm instilled by the glorious Iberian scenery (photographed by James Clarke in shimmering, almost edible pastels) could be savored uninterrupted by the performative patter of the two stars, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. I imagine that the diners seated near them in the restaurants where much of this movie takes place would have been grateful for mute buttons of their own.Like ¡°The Trip¡± in 2011 and ¡°The Trip to Italy¡± three years later, this latest cushy assignment sends the lads ¡ª once again playing Steve and Rob, mildly fictionalized versions of themselves ¡ª tootling around a randomly chosen region, sampling menus and trading banter. I hesitate to say jokes, because, unlike the bounce and zing of the first movie, the tone here is more sober and the humor more strained. Barely squeaking by on a familiar formula and flimsy narrative (Steve is writing a book; Rob is scribbling restaurant reviews for The New York Times), the actors convey a sense of going through the motions. Eating sumptuous meals without apparent relish, jogging separately through impossibly gorgeous towns, and firing off celebrity impersonations with wearying one-upmanship, they perform with the competitive reflexivity of the longtime double act.Yet even artists as gifted as these two can only hitchhike so long on the charisma of household names like Mick Jagger and Michael Caine, and the dueling impressions that fuel the franchise have become effortful and repetitive. (One extended bit on Roger Moore is tortured to the point of desperation.) And though the spaces between the funny voices are filled with verdant hillsides and vanilla beaches that stretch the length of the frame, there¡¯s an occasional sour edge to the comedic sparring.This comes almost entirely from Steve, whose midlife anxieties ¡ª including an elusive, married lover and a neglectful agent ¡ª are the burr under the movie¡¯s saddle.

Moral indifference is an easy path, and it leads to other, graver sins, including cruelty and dishonesty. But the harder road of decency has its own traps and byways, as a young doctor named Jenny Davin discovers.Jenny, played with somber concentration by Ad¨¨le Haenel, is devoted to her profession and her patients. She is thorough and compassionate, scolding her intern (Olivier Bonnaud) for failing to keep his emotions in check and communicating clearly and efficiently with the mostly poor people who come to her office. On the verge of moving into a more prestigious position, she decides, almost impulsively, to stay where she is, and take over her retired mentor¡¯s small general practice. It¡¯s what she loves, and she is loved in return.But in the Dardennes¡¯ moral universe the ways of love are never simple. Having established that Jenny is a good person, the film allows her what at first seems to be a trivial lapse. Late one evening, long after office hours have finished, the front buzzer sounds and Jenny decides to ignore it.

Its main characters, who live in the central Mexican city of Guanajuato, are young, gloomy, attractive men and women connected by friendship, family ties and sexual longing and divided by those same things. The movie, directed by Amat Escalante from a script he wrote with Gibr¨¢n Portela, might be a dour, observant study of modern relationships among the urban middle class were it not for the presence of a slimy, many-tentacled space creature living in a cabin in the countryside.The thing ostensibly arrived on an asteroid, but its more salient provenance is a pornographic tradition, notably but not exclusively Japanese, that occasionally slithers into the cinematic mainstream. The alien, whose gender is indeterminate, is awesome in bed, though not always gentle. While its partners, male and female, experience inexpressible and addictive bliss in its company, some of them also suffer grievous and even fatal injuries.The first one we meet is Ver¨®nica (Simone Bucio). While being treated for an alien-sex-related mishap she pretends is a dog bite, she befriends Fabi¨¢n (Eden Villavicencio), a nurse. His sister, Alejandra (Ruth Ramos), is married to ¨¢ngel (Jes¨²s Meza), a drunken macho sad sack who is having an affair with Fabi¨¢n. Fabi¨¢n, encouraged by Ver¨®nica, finds his way to the extraterrestrial love shack (which is tended by a sweet, hippie-ish older couple). But it¡¯s Alejandra, neglected by ¨¢ngel and stressed out by their two young sons and ¨¢ngel¡¯s domineering mother, who seems like the most likely victim. Or lover. Or whatever you call it.Mr. Escalante¡¯s previous film, ¡°Heli,¡± was about a factory worker caught up in Mexico¡¯s drug violence. It contains several horrific ¡ª and now notorious ¡ª scenes of brutality, but what makes those moments especially unnerving is the low-key domestic naturalism in which they are embedded. Mr. Escalante is an exceptionally deft and subtle realist, and you sometimes feel, in ¡°Heli¡± and even more so in ¡°The Untamed¡± that he is drawn to extremity partly out of boredom with his own skill. And so he turns a downbeat melodrama of unhappy marriage, bohemian drift and sexual duplicity into something bizarre and horrific. There is another possibility, though, which is that ¡°The Untamed¡± is not a slice-of-life tale pretending to be a monster movie, but rather a bone-dry comedy pretending to be both of those things. There is a fine line between horror and humor, and if you adjust your angle of vision accordingly, you can see the architecture of farce beneath the ornamentation of shock and suffering. The meticulous deadpan of the performances diverts attention from the absurdity of the circumstances. Fabi¨¢n, ¨¢ngel and Alejandra are joined in a classic triangle, which Ver¨®nica and the alien throw into high relief even as they disrupt it.Also: Interplanetary, interspecies sex might function better as a sick joke than an earnest metaphor.

In lieu of flying shrapnel and fancy production design, the director ramps the intensity to 11, then breaks the dial. Sweaty, square-jawed close-ups substitute for fighting, and fake blood is doled out by the thimbleful. Special effects are hoarded for maximum shock and awe.For a while, this formula works as Sergeant Isaac (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) hunkers behind a crumbling wall in a godforsaken swath of Iraq, pinned down by an unseen enemy sniper. The year is 2007, and the war is winding down; but Isaac and his commanding officer, Staff Sgt.

Matthews has already been severely wounded and lies unconscious on the other side of the wall.

The hoped-for marriage isn¡¯t just a test of Michal¡¯s happiness but also of her religiosity: A rabbi warns Michal against ¡°counting on miracles,¡± and wonders what will happen to her faith if she doesn¡¯t find a husband in time.Ms. Burshtein asks viewers to take a leap of faith as well with a borderline surreal finale, which finds Michal, woozy in close-ups during a fast, trying to comprehend what¡¯s happening around her.

There are killings, rapes and beatings, episodes of revenge and casual cruelty, and the subtle but no less brutal operations of poverty, corruption and social injustice. But though we occasionally witness the immediate aftereffect of these acts, we virtually never see the acts themselves. In a departure from the usual cinematic practice that amounts to a critique of prevailing assumptions about the power of visual representation, Mr. Diaz insists that words can carry meaning more effectively than pictures.Which is not to say that this movie, which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival last year, is unconcerned with showing what happens. Shot in a black-and-white palette that evokes both Italian neorealism and old television, ¡°The Woman Who Left¡± is carefully composed and hauntingly beautiful to behold. Like Mr. Diaz¡¯s earlier work, it is long and slow-moving, but at nearly four hours it feels less like a test of your endurance than an appeal to your appetite for character, incident and emotion.The setting is the modern Philippines (the main action begins in 1997), but the inspiration is ¡°God Sees the Truth, but Waits,¡± a story by Tolstoy, and the mood and pace evoke the rich pleasures of great 19th-century fiction. Mr. Diaz has explored this kind of transcultural and trans-historical cross-pollination before, notably in ¡°Norte, the End of History,¡± which drew on Dostoyevsky¡¯s ¡°Crime and Punishment.¡± ¡°The Woman Who Left¡± is less sprawling ¡ª more portrait than tableau ¡ª and it brings to the screen a character who is at once elusive and unforgettable.Her name is Horacia, though she occasionally hides behind pseudonyms. We first encounter her in a rural women¡¯s prison, where she reads stories to her fellow inmates and tutors their young children. The place seems peaceful and humane (especially in contrast to what will follow), and Horacia, played with exquisite understatement by Charo Santos-Concio, seems resigned to her life there. But then, 30 years into her sentence, she is freed, and we learn that she was framed for murder by a former lover. The real killer confesses and commits suicide, sending Horacia on a journey into a tragic past and an uncertain future. Mr. Diaz tells her story without flashbacks or gimmicks, with a plainness that masks the complexity of his ambitions. Stoical and selfless, Horacia resembles one of the suffering mothers of classic Hollywood melodrama. And her post-incarceration adventures unfold under film-noir-like shadows. She befriends outcasts and outlaws ¡ª notably a transgender prostitute (John Lloyd Cruz) and a street vendor (Nonie Buencamino) ¡ª and quietly stalks Rodrigo Trinidad (Michael De Mesa), the man who wronged her.Handsome and self-confident, Rodrigo lives a life of wealth and power in a gated compound, emerging occasionally to attend Mass and bathe in the flattery of a young priest. He hasn¡¯t paid in any way for the years he stole from Horacia. She observes him from a distance, and it is not clear ¡ª perhaps not even to her ¡ª whether she is planning to confront or kill him, or if witnessing the unfairness of their respective circumstances is all the justice she can expect.Mr. Diaz¡¯s view of human affairs is pessimistic. He is fascinated by guilt and innocence but skeptical of the possibility of redemption. Yet his films, this one even more than ¡°Norte,¡± are the opposite of despairing. The last shots of ¡°The Woman Who Left¡± are devastating, and the film makes uncompromising demands on your attention and your empathy. But it is also illuminating and, in its downbeat, deliberate way, exhilarating.",0.999016045041933,"Drama"

The slight is a punch in the gut, but it also starts a revolution.The story begins when the women¡¯s balcony at the synagogue collapses during the bar mitzvah celebration for Ettie¡¯s grandson. The accident leaves the rabbi¡¯s wife in a coma and the rabbi in a state of shock, which puts the future of the congregation in limbo; rabbis have to supervise repairs.

The book tells the true story of a Polish couple who rescued about 300 Jews from the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust and sheltered them in their zoo.What does it say that the most stirring scenes in a movie that avoids graphic depictions of Nazi barbarism involve the heroic title character, Antonina Zabinska (Jessica Chastain), lovingly interacting with the animals in the Warsaw Zoo, which she runs with her husband, Jan (Johan Heldenbergh)?In these tender moments, ¡°The Zookeeper¡¯s Wife,¡± directed by Niki Caro (¡°Whale Rider¡±), from an anemic screenplay by Angela Workman, shucks off its modesty and transforms into the sentimental portrait of a beautiful woman and the animals she cares for like a devoted parent. You can trust animals, but not people, she declares. Her beloved charges get more screen time than the Jews whose lives the couple saves and who mostly remain anonymous, their personal stories left untold. They creep out of hiding and convene like a ghostly family when Antonina signals them by playing the piano. The most emotional scene has nothing to do with Nazis, Jews or the Holocaust. In this surefire set piece, which feels shoehorned into the film, Antonina saves the life of a baby elephant to which she administers CPR, risking being trampled by the adorable creature¡¯s agitated mother. Otherwise, ¡°The Zookeeper¡¯s Wife¡± plays like a medium-gloss rerun of other more gripping depictions of Nazi evil and Jewish suffering.It at least sustains a cool pictorial grandeur in its portrayal of the Nazi invasion of Poland as bombers sweep the skies and armored tanks roll into Warsaw as the city erupts in panic, its peace and quiet shattered in one horrifying instant. As bombs rain on the zoo, the frightened, confused animals run wild in the streets, and amid the chaos an elephant is shot.After the invasion, Antonina and Jan are greeted with unctuous cordiality by Lutz Heck (Daniel Br¨¹hl), a suave Nazi zoologist who offers to transport the zoo¡¯s most prized animals to Berlin for safekeeping. During their stay, he says, he plans to use them for selective breeding. To keep the zoo from being closed, the quick-witted couple come up with the idea of converting it into a hog farm, which would produce meat to feed the German soldiers. The animals subsist on garbage retrieved from the Warsaw ghetto in daily truck runs. Jan¡¯s plan is to smuggle Jews hidden under the refuse to the zoo, where they are secreted in the basement of the house occupied by the family, which includes their young son, Ryszard (played at different ages by Timothy Radford and Val Maloku).There are ample opportunities for the movie to stir up fear each time the truck leaves the ghetto, but the film has little appetite for cliffhanging suspense. The fugitives who emerge from under the garbage don¡¯t look much the worse for wear. Although not without moments of terror and desperation, the screenplay¡¯s leisurely timing subverts their dramatic impact.A subplot involves Antonina¡¯s precarious balancing act as she charms the besotted Lutz, and resists surrendering to his increasingly aggressive moves as her jealous husband watches nervously from a distance. The screenplay is so frightened of this material that it isn¡¯t always clear whether she has succumbed. But as Lutz evolves from a charmer into a bad, bad Nazi, the question of did she or didn¡¯t she give in seems a feeble attempt to pump romantic excitement into a drama in dire need of moral complexity.Ms. Chastain¡¯s watchful, layered performance helps keep the film on an even keel, but it is not enough to prevent ¡°The Zookeeper¡¯s Wife,¡± with its reassuringly cuddly critters, from feeling like a Disney version of the Holocaust.",0.408967436086933,"Biography"

An unalloyed charmer, the movie tells a story of familiar British grit and resolve during World War II from an attractively different angle: that of an advertising copywriter, Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton), who¡¯s recruited by the government to join the film industry. Britain wants the United States to enter the war, and has decided cinematic propaganda is the way it can persuade the movie-mad Yanks to sign up. The world is facing a historic catastrophe, after all; but for this ambitious young woman it¡¯s also a bittersweet opportunity.It¡¯s the latest addition to an appealing British subgenre: the home-front story that reminds you that among grim air raids and explosions, people also just lived their lives, sometimes with laughter and unexpected new freedoms, as in John Boorman¡¯s 1987 autobiographical film, ¡°Hope and Glory,¡± about childhood during the Blitz. The director of ¡°Their Finest,¡± Lone Scherfig, is Danish (her breakthrough was ¡°Italian for Beginners¡±), but she has carved out a curious niche making British period stories, most notably ¡°An Education.¡± She has fine timing and wit ¡ª the behind-the-scenes filmmaking sections in ¡°Their Finest¡± are delightful, note-perfect sendups ¡ª and while her visuals tend to be overly buffed, she¡¯s more ambitious with her performers, who retain their rough, human edges. After being called up to duty, Catrin is paired with Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin), a dyspeptic screenwriter who nonetheless grasps her talent. With British men off fighting the Nazis, the domestic film industry needs all the help it can get, even if this means deviating from its entrenched sexism. For Catrin, who¡¯s shacked up in a bleak London flat with her husband, Ellis (Jack Huston), the new career and its opportunities are as welcome as the pay. La vie boh¨¨me doesn¡¯t seem to be cutting it, especially because Ellis ¡ª a struggling painter given to slashing, cluttered canvases in shades of dung (the movie is clearly on the side of the popular arts) ¡ª insists on stirring up trouble. Adapted by Gabby Chiappe from a novel by Lissa Evans, ¡°Their Finest¡± settles into focus once Catrin and Buckley start working on a film intended to rally the United States to the cause. Initially assigned to writing ¡°the slop,¡± or women¡¯s dialogue, Catrin quickly rises to the occasion, typing reams of dialogue while gracefully, sometimes messily navigating a crowd of tetchy narcissists, mostly male. Even with so many men away at war, Catrin is outnumbered at work, which makes sense, given the film industry. Yet partly because ¡°Their Finest¡± is so wonderfully cast, both Ms. Arterton and her character often come close to being upstaged by their scene-stealing male cohort, a somewhat perilous turn for a female-driven story about a woman finding herself and her voice. A pleasant, somewhat stolid presence, Ms. Arterton nonetheless manages, mostly through sheer screen time, to create a character who can hold her own against these free-ranging peacocks, none prouder and screechier than Buckley, a romantic foil whose sourness Mr. Claflin keeps in check with glints of soul. It¡¯s an alluring performance, pitched between leathery guardedness and vulnerability, and spiked with the genial self-abnegation that defined Hugh Grant¡¯s early career. Mr. Claflin could have run off with ¡°Their Finest,¡± except that he¡¯s just one in a gang of wily thieves who include Eddie Marsan, Jeremy Irons, Jake Lacy, Richard E. Grant (king of the reaction shots) and that sly puss Bill Nighy as a faded star in permanent high dudgeon over his career.As the film-within-the film progresses and as Catrin struggles with her own drama (and romantic agonies worthy of a classic women¡¯s picture), a few others muscle into the boys¡¯ club, including Phyl (Rachael Stirling), a dispenser of feminist truths in slacks. The character who most beautifully embodies the story¡¯s ideals, though, is Sophie (Helen McCrory), who, as a talent agent, brings man and dog to heel in a few short, barbed scenes. She¡¯s the kind of no-nonsense woman you can imagine contributed to the real war effort, including in the film industry. ¡°Their Finest¡± is too understandably serious to be called a romp, yet it has a buoyancy that lifts you and, in Ms. McCrory, a woman who does, too.",0.997771719751923,"Comedy"

In camcorder footage from the ¡¯90s, her father, David, invokes ¡°America¡¯s Funniest Home Videos¡± as the infant then named Gregory Allan Lazzarato does something winsomely amusing.

While Ms. Kopple is best known for the strong voice and sharp eye she brings to projects about social injustice (her Academy Award-winning ¡°Harlan County USA¡± and ¡°American Dream¡± chronicled labor conflicts in the heartland), in this movie the political takes a relatively distant back seat to the personal.Most of the footage in the first two-thirds is archival, with clips shot by Ms. Lazzarato as she chronicles surgical procedures during her transition from male to female.

He needs to make a getaway ¡ª he¡¯s neck deep in trouble and plot entanglements ¡ª so identifies himself as the ¡°strongest Avenger.¡± No dice. Given his earlier stand-alone movies, Thor might have had better luck cracking the code if he¡¯d copped to being the ¡°most boring Avenger.¡±Through no fault of their likable star, Chris Hemsworth, the Thor movies have been largely forgettable, memorable mostly for the upstaging antics of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and as a bad fit for Natalie Portman (Thor¡¯s former love interest, now mercifully banished into the storytelling cornfield). ¡°Ragnarok¡± tries hard to change that profile, and mostly succeeds by knocking its big, blond beauty consistently down to size. It makes sense for all sorts of reasons, including that superheroes can so easily appear to be on the wrong side of history, especially those who look like Aryan cartoons. That isn¡¯t Thor¡¯s fault; he was drawn that way. But times change, and a conceptual makeover was necessary ¡ª and not just to boost his box-office appeal. Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn¡¯t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It¡¯s a good fit, at least for a while. Like some other superheroes, Thor has been good for the occasional light, mocking laugh, often hooked to his otherworldly identity: He¡¯s a god (as he likes to announce), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and so forth. For much of ¡°Ragnarok,¡± he¡¯s a playfully sustained joke. As a storyteller, the director Taika Waititi (¡°Hunt for the Wilderpeople¡±) has a charmingly idiosyncratic human touch and a gift for turning goofiness and gab into personality. That gift is first evident here in the intimate huddles between Thor and whoever happens to be within chatting (or shouting) distance. There¡¯s a lot of yakking, some barking; at one point, Odin does some god-splaining. The Chatty Cathies also include Thor¡¯s sister, Hela (a vamping Cate Blanchett), an overgrown Goth Girl with smudged eye makeup and killer dominatrix looks who plays very hard. She lusts for Odin¡¯s realm, which remains as drearily amorphous and anonymous as before.The story is an uninteresting thicket of brawls, machinations and useful coincidences. (Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay.) Soon after Hela appears, she moves back home and Thor lands elsewhere, allowing her to run amok ¡ª kill, strut, repeat ¡ª and him to leisurely settle into his new, more lighthearted mode until it¡¯s serious hammer time. Much of his great un-Thoring happens on Sakaar, a planetary garbage dump run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, comically jiving and dithering), a psychopath Auntie Mame in flowing gold lam¨¦ and blue fingernail polish who suggests a low-rent version of Stanley Tucci¡¯s host in ¡°The Hunger Games.¡± The Grandmaster presides over a gladiatorial game, an exasperatingly lazy and uninteresting story development that is mostly (mostly) alleviated by Mr. Waititi¡¯s handling of the material. It¡¯s here that the vibe relaxes and the picture¡¯s filigree becomes brighter and wittier as extras with puffball hairdos straight out of Dr. Seuss light up the background. It¡¯s also here that Thor reunites with the Hulk, who¡¯s been crushing the gladiatorial competition on an extended incredible bender. After he and Thor engage in some Steinbeckian George-and-Lennie riffing, the Hulk¡¯s inner mouse, Bruce Banner, takes over, and Mark Ruffalo eases in to help turn the temperature from hot to cozy.Mr. Hemsworth looks happier and far more relaxed in ¡°Ragnarok¡± than he did in the previous Thor vehicles, which is perhaps Mr. Waititi¡¯s truest achievement here. For a guy who looks chiseled by Michelangelo, Mr. Hemsworth can be a surprisingly agile physical performer, capable of real bounce, and he clearly likes ricocheting off walls as much as he does ceding center stage to the other actors. These include Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, who, after an unpromising entrance, develops into a real character with emotion and an all-too-brief flashback filled with fury, beauty, liquid motion and mythological mystery. That scene is a jolt, because it¡¯s a reminder of the narrative ambition and mythic grandeur that¡¯s often reduced in this franchise to epic fights, fancy elocution and special effects. It¡¯s amusing how ¡°Ragnarok¡± humanizes Thor, yet in doing so it dilutes his Thorness, the essential qualities that make him more than a dude with a cool hammer. And the more familiar and less godlike he becomes, the more evident it is that this series has never figured out how to make his myth fit with the modern world. So it¡¯s made Thor a fish out of water and a recurrent punch line. Now, though, with Thor (and Mr. Hemsworth) at last settled in, what he needs is a myth as mighty as his shtick.",0.718580371372005,"Action"

It happens during an uneasily intimate encounter between her character, a tough number named Mildred, and an ailing police chief, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Until then, Mildred has seemed impervious to his pain. She has rented three billboards attacking his failure to solve her daughter¡¯s murder ¡ª one reads ¡°Raped While Dying¡± ¡ª and has been so wrapped up in her hurt that she hasn¡¯t seen anyone else¡¯s. When she realizes how sick Willoughby is, she looks at him as if for the first time. She¡¯s staggered, and so are you.The pain of others haunts ¡°Three Billboards,¡± at least whenever the writer-director Martin McDonagh lets it. A playwright (¡°The Pillowman¡±) turned filmmaker (¡°In Bruges¡±) who¡¯s somewhat of a subgenre unto himself, Mr. McDonagh is a pain artist whose tools include absurd violence, cruel laughs and sucker punches. He skated through his last movie, ¡°Seven Psychopaths,¡± a barely there comedy that pivots on a creatively stalled screenwriter. As this pr¨¦cis suggests, Mr. McDonagh doesn¡¯t have much to say in that movie ¡ª it has a bunny, stolen dogs, guys with guns, good and bad jokes ¡ª but what little is said is said by very fine performers grooving on all his words and larky nonsense. ¡°Three Billboards¡± is more ambitious than Mr. McDonagh¡¯s earlier features. Like the older ones, it has loads of gab, plenty of guns and the spectacle of men (mainly) behaving terribly. It also restlessly, if not satisfyingly, shifts between comedy and tragedy ¡ª a McDonagh specialty ¡ª splattering blood along the way. This time, though, he has also given his movie characters instead of disposable contrivances, a plot instead of self-reflexive ideas about storytelling and a rather diffuse overarching metaphor. Mostly, he has freighted it with a tragedy that allows the performers ¡ª primarily Ms. McDormand but also the equally excellent Mr. Harrelson and Sam Rockwell ¡ª to play to their range. The movie opens on low boil with Mildred behind the wheel of her station wagon near three derelict billboards. It¡¯s an inviting landscape smudged with soft color, but as she stares at the signs with furrowed intensity, she chews on a fingernail so ferociously she seems on the verge of tearing it off. The billboards aren¡¯t blank ¡ª the faded image of a baby smiles down from one, the word ¡°life¡± pops off another ¡ª but they¡¯re the opening pages in Mildred¡¯s opus. Stamping black text against a blood-red background, she uses the billboards to announce her crusade while Mr. McDonagh (who likes self-aware gestures) lays out the story¡¯s fundamentals: its setting, characters, problem, plot and possible villain.The billboards are a gimmick for Mr. McDonagh and a gambit for Mildred, a way to get things jumping (the investigators, the tale) and splash some foreboding on an outwardly pacific scene. Much of the story involves the ripples of outrage, confusion and buffoonery that the billboards inspire and that soon envelop almost everyone Mildred knows. Months after her daughter¡¯s death, grief has walled her in; isolating and seemingly impenetrable, it is inscribed in the hardness of her gaze and in her grim new identity as a mother of a dead girl. The billboards turn that grief into a weapon, a means of taking on the law and assorted men ¡ª a threatening stranger, a vigilante dentist and an abusive ex (John Hawkes) ¡ª who collectively suggest another wall that has closed Mildred in. Mr. McDonagh likes to play comedy against violence and to wring laughs out of the unspeakable. This kind of juxtaposition (in his movies, at any rate) can produce laughter that catches in your throat, giving you pause and maybe provoking thought about why exactly you are giggling. But he doesn¡¯t always know his A material from his B, or doesn¡¯t care; his jokes can be uninterestingly glib with tiny, bloodless pricks that are less about challenging the audience than about obscuring the material¡¯s clich¨¦s and overriding theatricality. Everything fits together too neatly in ¡°Three Billboards,¡± even when chaos descends, but the performers add enough rough texture so that it doesn¡¯t always feel so worked.Ms. McDormand roughs it up beautifully.

But ¡ª surprise ¡ª the fifth ¡°Transformers¡± movie, ¡°The Last Knight,¡± is far from the worst in this continuing experiment in noisy nonsense based on Hasbro toys. That is thanks largely to two words: Anthony Hopkins.What Mr. Hopkins, a knighted Emmy and Oscar winner, is doing in a ¡°Transformers¡± movie is unclear, but he brings a goofy dignity to the enterprise that elevates this chapter over its recent brethren. The storytelling is also an upgrade. For one thing, we finally are given a believable explanation for the purpose of Stonehenge.Mark Wahlberg, who joined the franchise in the fourth film, the unwatchably long and convoluted ¡°Transformers: Age of Extinction,¡± is back as the scruffy inventor Cade Yeager.As this story opens, Cade is one of the few humans who still has some affection for Autobots, the robotic immigrants from outer space who mean well but whose war with the Decepticons has resulted in all sorts of havoc on Earth. The rest of humanity is still annoyed with them for wrecking a perfectly good city, Chicago, earlier in the franchise. Autobots and Decepticons transform into motor vehicles and other things, a special-effects sight that apparently never grows old for fans of the series. And they have what seems like an ever-changing back story. The one conjured here involves Arthur, Lancelot, Merlin and the Dark Ages, which is where Mr. Hopkins¡¯s character, Edmund Burton, comes in.He¡¯s a sort of keeper of the Arthurian/Transformers legend, and he knows that a long-forecast climactic battle is coming for control of Merlin¡¯s staff, an ancient relic that has formidable powers when wielded by the right person.In this case that person is Viviane (Laura Haddock), a British scholar who is skeptical of the Round Table tales and is also just the right age to be a potential romantic interest for Cade. As for Stonehenge, well, without giving away too much, let¡¯s just say that invaders from space are coming to suck the life out of our planet, and the great monument is not merely the clunkiest calendar ever made.Also in the mix are Lennox (Josh Duhamel), the military man from the previous movies; Jimmy (Jerrod Carmichael), Cade¡¯s jokey sidekick; and Izabella (Isabela Moner), the obligatory cute kid. The best touch, though, is Cogman (the voice of Jim Carter), Edmund¡¯s robotic butler, a sort of C-3PO with a temper (as a robot who aims a C-3PO joke at him finds out).This movie series can only wish it had the depth and coherence of the ¡°Star Wars¡± franchise, but the homage is nice, and Cogman and Edmund have some witty moments, something the more plodding sequels lacked. Michael Bay again directs, and he and his writers (Art Marcum, Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan are credited with the screenplay, and those three along with Akiva Goldsman with the story) put more humanity and less clanking into this installment. Mr. Bay seems to rein in his tendency for high-speed pursuits and robotic clashes somewhat, and he varies the vroom-vroom car-chase stuff by throwing in a submarine chase.But don¡¯t worry; if for some reason the drawn-out and incoherent battle scenes are what you liked about the earlier films, the climactic one here is still both of those things. The movie is shorter (by about 15 minutes) than the last one, though, and considerably more bearable.",0.619484787383165,"Action"

From a hunt in Namibia to a safari lodge in South Africa, from an animal control program in Zimbabwe to a Las Vegas convention hall, the narrative becomes only more complex and confounding. At any moment, whoever is onscreen ¡ª the hunter who believes he has a God-given right to shoot animals; the anti-poaching officer whose work is financed in part by the hunting industry; the poor villagers endangered by animals that the wealthy pay to kill ¡ª might challenge our assumptions and expose our ignorance.Layered, thoughtful and infinitely curious, ¡°Trophy¡± is shot so simply and beautifully, and with such nonjudgmental calm, that it¡¯s easy to miss the ingenuity of its construction. Intervening solely to offer the occasional devastating statistic, the filmmakers allow our perceptions to shift and slide with each new piece of information. Here, canny businessman and genuine animal lover share the same skin, and a high-end safari outfitter is no less concerned for his beasts than the most vehement anti-hunting activist.This blurring of lines is nowhere more pronounced than in the efforts of John Hume, the rhino breeder, to discourage illegal poaching by legalizing the sale of rhino horn.

Only when Kate discovers that Jamie can sing does she find a way to connect with her and offer some exciting possibilities.Yes, that plotline fuels the old myth of vocal or athletic ability as a magical way out of a disadvantaged life, but the movie, written by Nick Moorcroft and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, isn¡¯t content to be a feel-good story. Not every troubled young person has musical talent or can shed her surliness the first time a grown-up pays attention to her. One of those who doesn¡¯t and can¡¯t is Leanne (Isabella Laughland), Jamie¡¯s longtime friend, a street tough who is as eager to keep Jamie in juvenile delinquency as Kate is to save her.The fight scenes are nasty, the language is harsh and the three leads are utterly convincing.",0.979657546948412,"Crime"

To say that ¡°Valerian¡± is a science-fiction epic doesn¡¯t quite do it justice. Imagine crushing a DVD of ¡°The Phantom Menace¡± into a fine powder, tossing in some Adderall and Ecstasy and a pinch of cayenne pepper and snorting the resulting mixture while wearing a virtual reality helmet in a Las Vegas karaoke bar. Actually, that sounds like too much fun, but you get the idea. Mr. DeHaan plays Valerian and Ms. Delevingne plays Laureline, who are not his-and-hers dental hygiene products but rather soldiers in some kind of space army. They are also at least potentially a couple, a fact which authorizes a lot of dialogue that might technically be called ¡°banter¡± but that seems to have lost its snap after passing through Google translate a few times too many. Anyway, Valerian and Laureline are as cute as a pair of baby salamanders. Their mission ¡ª do I have to do this part? ¡ª involves justice for the planet M¨¹l.

That distinctive voice would later become a terrific vehicle for punch lines. After gaining fame onstage, where she sang a duet with Evelyn Nesbit (the chorus girl whose husband killed the architect Stanford White, setting off a media circus), she moved to radio, film and most notably television. There she co-starred as a wisecracking comedy writer on ¡°The Dick Van Dyke Show,¡± and later for many years on ¡°Hollywood Squares.¡± In between the successes of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, Rose Marie, this movie argues, was one of the most important female comic voices in America.Carl Reiner and Mr. Van Dyke provide colorful personal testimony about working with her ¡ª and Dan Harmon, the creator of ¡°Community,¡± displays an insightful critic¡¯s eye ¡ª but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage. Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection.Jason Wise¡¯s documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked.

One night, aided by the serendipitous convergence of a delayed train and a dead cellphone battery, he slips out of his routine and into an odd kind of exile. Instead of walking in the front door to greet his wife, Diana, and their twin daughters, Wakefield betakes himself to a storage room above the garage, where he can observe his own absence through a small window.He remains there for months, becoming something of a living poltergeist, invisibly haunting the domestic space that had once belonged to him. There are other ways to describe him: as a creepy voyeur, sadistically observing the pain and confusion his departure has caused; as a mock-heroic dissident, rejecting the emptiness and inauthenticity of modern middle-class existence; or even, more philosophically, as ¡°the Outcast of the Universe.¡±That last phrase comes from a sketch, also called ¡°Wakefield,¡± by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The movie, written and directed by Robin Swicord and starring Bryan Cranston and Jennifer Garner, isn¡¯t based on that tale, but on a much longer 2008 story by E. L. Doctorow, which elegantly updates and expands some of Hawthorne¡¯s themes. The idea of escape ¡ª specifically the male fantasy of flight from a supposedly female-dominated world of family and responsibility ¡ª is at least as old as Rip Van Winkle, and Doctorow¡¯s text is in part a sly and self-conscious commentary on that literary tradition. His Wakefield is a creature of words, less a man than a conceit.In spite of Mr. Cranston¡¯s guile and grit, Ms. Swicord¡¯s ¡°Wakefield¡± is something less than that. The film, scrupulously faithful to its source, is decidedly literary, but not in an especially satisfying way. In its view of suburban discontent and masculine malaise, it leans on borrowed insights and an unearned aura of significance. Too mannered for realism and too thin for fable, it spins its wheels in a social and intellectual void filled only by Wakefield¡¯s voice-over musings and the shadow of Doctorow¡¯s virtuosity. Wakefield watches as Diana¡¯s initial shock gives way to grief and then ¡ª maybe a little too quickly ¡ª to resignation, and he reminisces about their courtship and early marriage. She was a dancer when they met, dating a friend of his (Jason O¡¯Mara), and Wakefield narrates with cruel relish the way he stole her affections and spirited her away to the suburbs. There, she raised the children and worked at an art museum, while he feathered the nest and rode the Metro-North rails.Now, his clothes filthy and his beard overgrown, Wakefield ventures out at night to scavenge his neighbors¡¯ trash. On occasions when he goes out in daylight, he is confident that no one will recognize him. His emotions swing from liberation to anguish, with a consistent note of contempt ¡ª for his family, for his circumstances and above all for himself.None of it is quite believable. Ms. Swicord ¡ª and Mr. Cranston, too ¡ª seem trapped in Wakefield¡¯s solipsism. On the page, other people can be perceived through the screen of a narrator¡¯s consciousness: Diana¡¯s unreality is a symptom of her husband¡¯s self-absorption, an index of his unreliability. But onscreen, Ms. Garner disappears more thoroughly than Mr. Cranston, and it¡¯s frustrating rather than illuminating to see her reduced to a cipher and a symbol of someone else¡¯s discontent.

I¡¯ll tread lightly, but I don¡¯t think anything I say here can spoil its power.Two groups of humans have just battled, and the victors, having slaughtered the enemy, burst into raucous cheers. It¡¯s the kind of thing we¡¯ve seen in movies dozens of times before: the cheapening of mass death into an easy win for the good guys. Except that in this case we, the humans in the theater seats, are not the only ones watching. A crowd of apes is also present, an emerging society whose national epic this film and its companions have marvelously and improbably become. The apes pause to witness the aftermath of the carnage they have narrowly escaped, and their wordless, shocked response, registered above all on the face of Caesar, their leader, is an eloquent rebuke to a species that has abandoned any but a biological claim to the name human.Recall that ¡°ape not kill ape¡± is the political and moral foundation of ape civilization, handed down by Caesar, their Moses, though he hasn¡¯t always obeyed this commandment. The spectacle of people¡¯s rejoicing in the destruction of their own kind is upsetting, and as the audience absorbs the apes¡¯ shock, we become aware of another, deeper unease. We are now, three movies into this reborn franchise, entirely on the side of the apes. The prospect of our own extinction, far from horrifying, comes as a relief. At last the poor planet will catch a break.Or, to put it another way, Koba was right.If you saw ¡°Dawn of the Planet of the Apes¡± ¡ª the second chapter in the series so far, bridging ¡°Rise¡± and ¡°War¡± ¡ª you may recall that poor, abused laboratory chimp¡¯s evolution from victim to nemesis. The damage Koba had suffered at the hands of humans made him intolerant and fanatical, an embodiment of political extremism who needed to be checked, and ultimately destroyed, by Caesar, whose political temperament tended toward moderation and compromise. Their conflict was mirrored by a struggle on the human side between a genocidal, ape-hating military commander and a rival leader who believed in coexistence. ¡°Dawn,¡± like ¡°Rise¡± before it, rested on a hopeful, slightly hokey message of interspecies harmony. In spite of their differences and mutual suspicions, maybe the two primate societies, one coalescing while the other slid toward chaos, could share the Earth, or at least the stretch of Northern California forest where this franchise plants its allegorical flag. Times change. ¡°War for the Planet of the Apes,¡± directed by Matt Reeves, is the grimmest episode so far, and also the strongest, a superb example ¡ª rare in this era of sloppily constructed, commercially hedged cinematic universes ¡ª of clear thinking wedded to inventive technique in popular filmmaking. The distinction of this run of ¡°Planet of the Apes¡± movies has been its commitment to the venerable belief that science fiction belongs to the literature of ideas, and its willingness to risk seeming to take itself too seriously. Each episode has pursued a stark ethical or political problem, and each has shifted the moral ground from human to ape.¡°Rise¡± was about how people treat and mistreat animals, about the tension between recognizing them as sentient beings and the long habit of exploiting and confining them. ¡°Dawn¡± was a wishful parable of decolonization and counterinsurgency, concerned with the competing but equally legitimate claims of two tribes occupying adjacent territory. ¡°War¡± ¡ª which, in spite of its title, is less a war film than a western wrapped around a prison movie ¡ª vindicates Koba¡¯s view of humanity as irredeemably cruel and deceitful.The memory of Koba¡¯s own treachery is kept alive, as some of his followers have drifted from militant anti-Caesarism to collaboration with the enemy species. There is a new nemesis in town, a renegade colonel played by Woody Harrelson, who goes full Heart of Darkness, staging a one-man remake of ¡°Apocalypse Now¡± in a medical base he has refashioned into a concentration camp. He has Marlon Brando¡¯s clean-shaven dome, Robert Duvall¡¯s mirrored sunglasses and Dennis Hopper¡¯s manic verbosity. The horror! The horror! Really, though, it¡¯s a lot of fun, in spite of the somber picture I¡¯ve been painting. Mr. Reeves, who also directed ¡°Dawn,¡± has a dark vision, but also a light touch when necessary, and, above all, a commitment to creating a world that is coherent as well as fantastical. This world is also intensely and somewhat unimaginatively masculine. The default setting for primate social organization in these movies, human and otherwise, is patriarchal, and while a few female apes and a young human girl appear on screen, the filmmakers¡¯ inability to flesh out the familial and affective dimensions of an otherwise richly rendered reality is frustrating.But still, the motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up. Andy Serkis¡¯s performance as Caesar is one of the marvels of modern screen acting, and it¡¯s complemented by those of Karin Konoval, reprising her role as the wise orangutan Maurice, and Steve Zahn, as a sad-clown sidekick named Bad Ape.Caesar and Maurice communicate in primitive English and sign language, and for long stretches their adventures unfold without much human interaction, though they do adopt a mute human orphan (Amiah Miller) shortly before they meet Bad Ape. Our ilk is in a bad way, and not only because of the fanatical, desperate militarism represented by the Colonel. A new strain of virus is robbing people of their ability to speak, accelerating a reversal of species hierarchy set in motion two movies ago when Caesar first howled the word ¡°no.¡±He is a grayer, sadder hero now, and in ¡°War¡± he succumbs for a while to a vengeful impulse at odds with his essential high-mindedness. You could say that he is putting his humanity at risk, or that he¡¯s only human, after all, but of course both descriptions would be absurd. We¡¯ll have to come up with a new vocabulary, but while we still have this one ¡ª and while flesh-and-blood people are still directing digital gorillas and chimps ¡ª I¡¯ll just say that it¡¯s good to see a movie so thoroughly humane.",0.999839618708073,"Action"

The sardonic tones of the accompanying narration ¡ª voiced by someone whose identity will be revealed later on ¡ª are an early indication that Mr. Pitt may not be the hero of the story. Glen McMahon, the four-star general he is playing, has no doubts on that score. McMahon, a man of many macho nicknames (the Glenimal, for example) is a man¡¯s man, a soldier¡¯s soldier, a warrior with the soul of a poet ¡ª the walking embodiment of just about every clich¨¦ in the book.But the particular book that inspired ¡°War Machine,¡± ¡°The Operators¡± by Michael Hastings, is a sharp, nuanced deconstruction of the modern military mythology. The book grew out of a notorious Rolling Stone profile of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who was put in charge of the war in Afghanistan in 2009 and proceeded to blow up his own career. Mr. Hastings, who died in 2013, sketched a rollicking, damning portrait of a commander in over his head, enthralled by his own hype and in less than perfect control of his mouth. That¡¯s the guy Mr. Pitt is supposed to be.In adapting Mr. Hastings¡¯s journalism, David Mich<U+00F4>d, the writer and director of ¡°War Machine,¡± also streaming on Netflix, has taken some risks of his own. The movie is fiction, but it hugs the shore of reality, occasionally running aground on the facts. It¡¯s a bit awkward ¡ª though not unusual ¡ª for semi-invented characters to brush up against real people. Anthony Michael Hall plays a volatile colleague of McMahon¡¯s who seems to be based on Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whose more recent adventures may provide fodder for a sequel. The actual President Obama appears on a television news clip, and is played later in a brief scene on an airport tarmac by an actor named Reggie Brown. Ben Kingsley wickedly impersonates Hamid Karzai, at the time the president of Afghanistan. That is a brilliant piece of casting. At its best, ¡°War Machine¡± crackles with irreverent wit, even if American political craziness circa 2009 looks tame compared with the 2017 version. It takes a while to get going, though. A raft of secondary characters is introduced via voice-over, but most of them fade into the desert-camo background. The few that stand out ¡ª Mr. Hall¡¯s fireplug, Topher Grace¡¯s glib fixer ¡ª make the labored introductions superfluous. And as you follow McMahon through the first stages of his new assignment, you may wish for a speedier, snappier rhythm. Mr. Mich<U+00F4>d¡¯s satirical intentions call out for something like the rapid-fire cynicism of Armando Iannucci, creator of ¡°Veep¡± and director of ¡°In the Loop,¡± or the gonzo iconoclasm of David O. Russell¡¯s ¡°Three Kings.¡± But after a sluggish and chaotic start, ¡°War Machine¡± finds its groove and becomes its own thing: a mordant, cleareyed critique of American war-making that is all the more devastating for being affectionately drawn.McMahon may be a blowhard and kind of an idiot, but he¡¯s not a bad guy. His judgment can be questioned, but not his sincerity. He is beloved by most of the men in his charge and unflinchingly committed to them. Their belief in him is exceeded only by his belief in himself as a legendary, larger-than-life figure. Everyone knows that he runs seven miles every morning, sleeps four hours a night and eats one meal a day. He his devoted to his wife (a wonderfully sly Meg Tilly) even though, as she points out over an anniversary dinner, they have spent 30 days in each other¡¯s company over the past eight years. McMahon is no tomcat, but no choirboy either. His attractive qualities of bluntness and loyalty are offset by a propensity for passive-aggressiveness in his dealings with civilian authority and a dogmatic attachment to some pretty dubious ideas. He is convinced that the war can be won and that he is the man who can win it. His hubris would be tragic if his overestimation of his own abilities were not so farcical. Mr. Mich<U+00F4>d, whose previous films include ¡°Animal Kingdom,¡± a gamy crime drama, and ¡°The Rover,¡± a dusty post-apocalyptic thriller, gestures toward the grim futility of the war on the ground. A subplot involves a young marine (Lakeith Stanfield), who questions the strategy he must nonetheless carry out, with terrible consequences. But most of the action is far from combat, consisting of hushed meetings and heated arguments.¡°War Machine¡± effectively rebuts the evergreen notion that military leaders are held back from victory by politicians and bureaucrats. It¡¯s not that the political and diplomatic aspects of American policy are excused, but rather that failure, to reverse the old saying, has a thousand fathers. McMahon, clinging to his faith in the dubious doctrines of counterinsurgency, chases after an illusory victory that his allies, colleagues and bosses don¡¯t really believe in any more. Is he ridiculous or noble? A little of both, perhaps.But ¡°War Machine,¡± as its title hints, is not entirely about him. Mr. Pitt¡¯s performance is engaging and complicated ¡ª somehow recalling both the wily and ruthless Aldo Raine of ¡°Inglourious Basterds¡± and the lethally stupid Chad Feldheimer of ¡°Burn After Reading¡± ¡ª but the film¡¯s most memorable words are none of the jargon that comes out of McMahon¡¯s mouth. In one indelible scene, a German member of Parliament (Tilda Swinton) delivers a calm, respectful and unsparing demolition of the American position. It is too long and complicated to quote here, but in another scene an Afghan villager offers a three-word summary: ¡°Please leave now.¡±",0.838502066877527,"Comedy"

You¡¯ve done it! You not only did it once, you¡¯ve done it twice. How many productions have you done?¡±Perhaps one reason Mr. Pacino is so dogged in his explorations of the play is because it¡¯s one that few others would think to cast him in. The lead male role, that of Herod, a king who promises the title character anything if she will dance for him, is a meaty one, to be sure. But even more than that of the title character, a royal daughter who is determined to kiss the mouth of John the Baptist even if that requires his decapitation, Herod as a character is a figure balanced on the knife edge of Camp. And if there¡¯s one mode of art that contemporary directors do not associate with Mr. Pacino, it¡¯s Camp. (At least with intentional Camp.) Which is not to say that Mr. Pacino interprets the character in an entirely uncharacteristic fashion. And I don¡¯t think that at any point in the documentary he even brings up Camp. But he does give Herod a fey, pansexually flirtatious side that one doesn¡¯t normally associate with Mr. Pacino, who, in most performances, whether quiet or manic, is almost always masculine in a conventionally unambiguous way. How his approach to the character works is answered by ¡°Salom¨¦,¡± the film. In a feat of artistic derring-do, while Mr. Pacino was acting in a Los Angeles theater production of the play directed by Ms. Parsons, he was himself directing a film version of the play on a nearby movie-studio soundstage. Mr. Pacino¡¯s documentary chronicles the feat; ¡°Salom¨¦¡± the movie shows the results of one of his efforts.Mr. Pacino¡¯s interpretation of the character is not ineffectual, and it finds its match in a Salom¨¦ played by Jessica Chastain, appearing several years before she achieved screen stardom. Their exchanges, and the exchanges between Ms. Chastain¡¯s Salom¨¦ and Kevin Anderson¡¯s John the Baptist, are frequently shot in close-up. The concentration of the performers and the power of Wilde¡¯s unusually baroque, even for him, language (he originally composed the play in French, as it happens) makes for some mesmerizing scenes. But whenever Mr. Pacino cuts away from these performers, a connection is severed. The viewer is made too privy to how, in this rendering, Mr. Pacino suspends the work uneasily between theater and cinema. In the documentary, there¡¯s a scene in which Mr. Pacino opens a newspaper and sees an ad for the theatrical production blaring ¡°Pacino Is Back.¡± He is immediately put off. ¡°You know, this is the problem,¡± he says. ¡°This is the problem with my whole life.¡± The movie never addresses it quite so explicitly, but ¡°Wilde Salom¨¦¡± is most fascinating as a portrait of a superstar actor who, for all his wealth and privilege, encounters unusual frustrations as he pursues genuine artistic ambitions.By the same token, though, not a lot of documentarians out there have the name-recognition clout to attract Tom Stoppard, Gore Vidal, Tony Kushner and, yes, Ireland¡¯s Artistic Ambassador to the World, Bono, to weigh in on Oscar Wilde for them. Mr. Pacino clashes with Ms. Parsons, with his movie producers and others. While much of the offstage drama has an authentic tartness, some of it feels manufactured, as in a scene at the movie¡¯s end that depicts Mr. Pacino asserting his aforementioned clout to get something the viewer has been persuaded to believe he will be denied. He becomes his own King Herod in a sense.

The juxtaposition of the imagery and the poetics make for a peculiar opening. Eventually it all makes tragic sense.Here, Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a federal wildlife officer who hunts predatory animals at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. He seems on intimate terms with the residents there; his ex-wife, with whom he has a young son and had a daughter, is a Native American with family on the reservation. While searching for a mountain lion that has been attacking livestock, he finds a corpse frozen in the mountain snow. The dead young woman, who suffered a head injury and was also raped, was the best friend of Cory¡¯s daughter, who died three years earlier under similar circumstances.Homicide on an Indian reservation, as it happens, is a federal crime. The F.B.I. ¡ª which, going by the attitude of the reservation¡¯s quiet police chief, is consistently less helpful than it should be ¡ª dispatches Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), a seemingly very green agent, to head the investigation. She shows up wearing an F.B.I. windbreaker, and Cory calmly informs her that she¡¯ll be dead within five minutes if she goes up the mountain dressed like that. ¡°See what they send us,¡± one resident says mournfully, shaking his head. In a different movie, the introduction of Jane and Cory would be a meet-cute. But Mr. Sheridan, who also avoided injecting a romantic theme into his script for ¡°Sicario,¡± in which Emily Blunt played an F.B.I. operative, has different, more serious reasons for making this character a woman. Jane acts partly as an audience surrogate, a well-intentioned outsider whose empathy and sincere desire to act on behalf of the female murder victim only gets her so far.The case lights up a cold fury in Cory. He reassures the victim¡¯s father, ¡°I¡¯m a hunter.¡± He demonstrates to Jane that in this terrain, it¡¯s the landscape that will yield the most important answers, not the frequently recalcitrant Indians whom Jane wants to interview. He¡¯s right, of course, and his wisdom is borne out in some gut-wrenching ways. Under David Mackenzie¡¯s direction, ¡°Hell or High Water¡± tended to overstate its hard-times-in-the-United-States theme; it seemed that every fifth shot or so showed a house foreclosure sale sign or a bankruptcy lawyer¡¯s billboard. As a director, Mr. Sheridan is a little more subtle than Mr. Mackenzie. This is kind of surprising; frequently, writers turned directors really like to bring the hammer down on their subtexts. But Mr. Sheridan limits himself to one shot of an American flag being flown upside down. Other than that, he lets the terrible situation on the reservation speak for itself. An actor before he was a screenwriter, Mr. Sheridan clearly spent a lot of his time learning about filmmaking on movie sets; his direction is assured throughout. A standoff scene near the movie¡¯s finale would not be shamed if put next to one of Michael Mann¡¯s better set pieces.The performances Mr. Sheridan draws from his cast are all excellent. Mr. Renner, who¡¯s been spending too much of his career imparting convincing humanity to a second-tier Marvel superhero, is in excellent form as Cory. Ms. Olsen, who has been co-starring in those Marvel films with Mr. Renner, is sympathetic as Jane. Graham Greene brings his customary quiet power and dry wit to the role of the police chief. The movie builds to a shocking climax, even though the revelation of the bad guys makes immediate, sickening sense. The film¡¯s ultimate statement sinks in later, with an expanded awareness that the justice done by the good guys in this film is not nearly sufficient with respect to the larger injustice done to Native Americans.",0.988745723251854,"Action"

Shannon Patricia O¡¯Neill, as Alex, a foul-mouthed friend, and Grace Rex, as Kim, her fianc¨¦e, add energy, but a bit more physical comedy would be welcome.Still, working with what was surely a minuscule budget, Ms. Jungermann supplies an awful lot of humor ¡ª some of it light, the best of it dark ¡ª in ¡°Women Who Kill.¡± Afterward, you may be compelled to go out for a drink, not just to discuss the story¡¯s peculiar ending, but also because this film¡¯s dryness leaves you feeling parched, in a very satisfying way.",0.978347523865606,"Comedy"

When the helmet is removed, we know how he knows what he knows: His young face is scarred, his earlobes are little flaps and his eyes are seemingly tear-shaped, giving him a perpetual sad-puppy expression.The good-natured fellow describes his facial birth defects, and the 27 operations he¡¯s endured to deal with them, as ¡°hilarious.¡± But Auggie is less amused by the prospect of entering the fifth grade, and no longer being home-schooled by his brilliant and loving mother, Isabel Pullman (Julia Roberts).The Pullmans are an upper-middle-class family living in a fairy-tale New York, one that the film¡¯s location manager conjured up from the most genteel corners of Brooklyn and Manhattan (as well as New Westminster, British Columbia, where the interior of the family¡¯s brownstone was built on a warehouse stage). So Auggie, whose father, Nate (Owen Wilson), has a job that lets him wear a suit and sneakers, is certainly going to a good school. Nonetheless, he knows that he will encounter bullies, and he does. But Auggie is smart, clever and exceptionally good-hearted (at least when he is not being made to feel self-conscious and alone), and has a knack for winning people over.The movie, based on the popular children¡¯s novel by R.J. Palacio, hews to the book¡¯s multicharacter narration structure. This tactic reminded me of a line in Jean Renoir¡¯s classic ¡°The Rules of the Game¡± about everybody having their own reasons for their behavior. In Renoir¡¯s movie, that fact is called a ¡°truly terrible thing.¡± In the world of this film, understanding another person¡¯s reasons is the first step in establishing meaningful communication. During the section of the film narrated by Auggie¡¯s older sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), you learn why, in an awkward first conversation with her future boyfriend, she impulsively tells him that she¡¯s an only child, despite the fact that she loves and ardently protects her little brother. Directed by Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the screenplay with Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne, the movie has a cast that¡¯s wonderful from top to bottom. As Auggie¡¯s parents, Ms. Roberts and Mr. Wilson are doing things we love to see those actors doing. (Ms. Roberts lets loose with her trademark ebullient laugh at least once, and Mr. Wilson explains life¡¯s issues to Auggie in a droll drawl.) All the young people in the ensemble, anchored by Mr. Tremblay¡¯s Auggie, are perfect.¡°Wonder¡± is that rare thing, a family picture that moves and amuses while never overtly pandering. Mr. Chbosky¡¯s 2012 feature, ¡°The Perks of Being a Wallflower,¡± split the difference between the sentimental heart-tugging associated with more standard Hollywood fare, and the intelligence and intimacy often associated with independent films.

It tells the story of a desperately, unhappily married woman whose affair with a local Romeo is derailed when he takes notice of her stepdaughter, whose breasts have been lit to glow like Vermeer peaches. The heart wants what it wants, as Mr. Allen once said by way of explaining his affair with his now wife, Soon-Yi, the daughter of his longtime ex, Mia Farrow. I tend to think it¡¯s a bad idea to put a movie on the couch, but what if it climbs on the couch and then starts winking?¡°Wonder Wheel¡± returns Mr. Allen to Coney Island, the childhood home of his alter ego Alvy Singer, the narrator of ¡°Annie Hall¡± who claims to have grown up under the amusement park¡¯s roller coaster. (¡°I have some trouble between fantasy and reality,¡± Alvy says.) In ¡°Wonder Wheel,¡± the sad wife, Ginny (Kate Winslet), lives in an apartment that looks directly onto the park¡¯s looming Ferris wheel. The attraction obscures her view of the ocean, literalizing already narrow horizons, and casts deep, expressionistic blue and red light on the apartment¡¯s dilapidated interior and its equally worn inhabitants.Ginny isn¡¯t all used up, despite the insistently unflattering way she is often presented. She winces and frowns a lot, and the camera conspires with the lighting and makeup to catch every twitch of distress, and the sweaty, oily sheen she never seems able to blot away. It¡¯s no surprise that she¡¯s worried. She works in a clam house on the boardwalk, scrambling for hoi polloi, while back at home she has to juggle her loud, loutish husband, Humpty (Jim Belushi), and her son, Richie (Jack Gore). Like the young Alvy in ¡°Annie Hall,¡± Richie is a redhead. But while Alvy is depressed about the universe, Richie seems largely troubled by his home life, specifically his demonstrably miserable mother.So, when Mickey (Justin Timberlake, too modern a presence), a lifeguard and self-described romantic, gives Ginny the once over, she gratefully falls into his arms. ¡°Wonder Wheel¡± more or less becomes Ginny¡¯s story, but she doesn¡¯t get to own it. The movie is narrated by Mickey, who pops in and out and looks directly into the camera. He has literary ambitions, as he likes to remind us, as well as a pad in Greenwich Village. For a while, Mickey offers Ginny a respite from her everyday grind, at least until the arrival of Carolina (a fine Juno Temple), Humpty¡¯s daughter from an earlier marriage. She¡¯s on the run from her gangster husband. ¡°I know where all the bodies are buried,¡± Carolina says. Somewhat of a cultural magpie, Mr. Allen has often folded bits and pieces ¡ª and at times entire conceits ¡ª from other work into his movies. Mickey mentions Eugene O¡¯Neill, a reference that suggests we¡¯re meant to see something of that playwright in Ginny and Humpty at their most raw and boozily fraught. Mr. Allen¡¯s often blunt, overwrought dialogue, however, also alternately brings to mind Budd Schulberg (¡°I coulda been a contender¡±) and imitation Clifford Odets. In some scenes, you almost expect Mr. Belushi, who¡¯s playing his heart out, to start bellowing about someone named Lefty. Much like its gaudy title attraction, ¡°Wonder Wheel¡± keeps on turning, even while going nowhere.This is Mr. Allen¡¯s second movie with the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who seems to have enjoyed taking the color wheel and camera out for a spin. He gives the story visual flow, even when the characters are in claustrophobic lockdown. And Mr. Storaro keeps your pupils dancing with the light and dark hues. Some of the establishing shots of Coney Island recall the softer side of Technicolor, whereas the violently saturated scenes suggest the vibrancy of the Blue Rider palette. The more extreme colors ¡ª including an unlovely orange light that floods Ginny ¡ª pushes the whole thing into expressionism even as the movie fluctuates between kitchen-sink realism and hothouse melodrama.Mr. Allen certainly keeps you busy with all these colors, tones, influences, complications, stereotypes and histrionics, but to little end. As has always been the case with his movies, the actors seem to have delivered the performances they came to the set with, so the strong ¡ª in this case, the invaluable Ms. Winslet ¡ª are strong while the rest of the cast members do what they can with varying degrees of success. Ginny, who yearns for something better than clam houses and brutality ¡ª and who is mercilessly punished for her yearning ¡ª could easily have become a monstrous, one-note clich¨¦. But Ms. Winslet fills this shabby character with feverish life. She conveys far more with a single, quietly stunned look than any of Mr. Allen¡¯s speeches or Mr. Storaro¡¯s color changes.At one point, after Ginny has turned into Blanche DuBois, she announces, ¡°When it comes to love we often turn out to be our own worst enemy.¡± And not for the first time you wonder what Mr. Allen, who has long blurred fact and fiction, thinks he¡¯s doing here. He couldn¡¯t have anticipated that his name would be in the news because of the allegations of sexual abuse upending the entertainment industry. Yet how could we not think of him? In 1993, he was accused of molesting his daughter, Dylan Farrow. He maintained his innocence and was never prosecuted, yet the allegations as well as discomfort about his marriage to Soon-Yi have hovered over him like a malignant cloud. Critics have often uneasily ignored his history, but he himself seems perversely intent on invoking it.",0.675394154485372,"Drama"

The viewer may be forgiven a shudder of dread. Are we really going to pick up where ¡°Batman v Superman¡± left off? Must we endure another dose of the grandiose self-pity and authoritarian belligerence that have characterized the DC-Warner Bros. synergy in the ¡°Dark Knight¡± era? (This is the cue for unhinged fans to come @ me on Twitter and accuse me of being a shill for Marvel and Disney. The rest of you are invited to keep reading.)The question is not rhetorical, and I¡¯m relieved to report that the answer is no. Once franchise continuity is established ¡ª a mysterious package from Bruce Wayne arrives at the office of Wonder Woman¡¯s alter ego, Diana Prince, who works in the Louvre¡¯s antiquities department ¡ª we are transported back to the heroine¡¯s earlier life, long before she became mixed up with Wayne and Clark Kent. ¡°Wonder Woman,¡± directed by Patty Jenkins from a script by Allan Heinberg, briskly shakes off blockbuster branding imperatives and allows itself to be something relatively rare in the modern superhero cosmos. It feels less like yet another installment in an endless sequence of apocalyptic merchandising opportunities than like ¡­ what¡¯s the word I¡¯m looking for? A movie. A pretty good one, too.By which I mean that ¡°Wonder Woman¡± tells an interesting, not entirely predictable story (until the climax, which reverts, inevitably and disappointingly, to dreary, overblown action clich¨¦s). It cleverly combines genre elements into something reasonably fresh, touching and fun. Its earnest insouciance recalls the ¡°Superman¡± movies of the ¡¯70s and ¡¯80s more than the mock-Wagnerian spectacles of our own day, and like those predigital Man of Steel adventures, it gestures knowingly but reverently back to the jaunty, truth-and-justice spirit of an even older Hollywood tradition. This is an origin story, first and foremost, establishing the mythic background and modern mission of its main character. That kind of movie can be tedious, but ¡°Wonder Woman¡± is leavened by touches of screwball comedy, espionage caper and romantic adventure, as well as by what might be the most credible superhero screen kiss since upside-down Tobey Maguire planted one on Kirsten Dunst way back in ¡°Spider-Man.¡± But I¡¯m getting ahead of myself. Diana Prince is, properly speaking, Princess Diana, daughter of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons (Connie Nielsen). The girl (played in childhood by Lilly Aspell and Emily Carey before maturing into Gal Gadot) grows up on a craggy Mediterranean island, a Bechdel-test paradise of flower-strewn meadows, noble horses and mighty quadriceps. Like a Disney princess ¡ª the resemblance hardly seems accidental ¡ª she is free-spirited and rebellious, her loyalties split between two opposed parental figures. Diana¡¯s mother wants her daughter to mind her tutors and steer clear of the warrior traditions represented by Antiope (Robin Wright), the girl¡¯s aunt.In the course of family arguments about Diana¡¯s destiny, the history of the Amazons is recounted, with emphasis on that tribe¡¯s ambivalent relations with men ¡ª meaning human beings generically and dudes in particular. There are none of the latter on the island, which has been sealed off from history and the rest of the world by a magic membrane. And then one day a screaming comes across the sky, and a World War I vintage fighter plane disgorges Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), a blue-eyed flyboy who is the living embodiment of the phrase ¡°not all men.¡±Steve, a spy for the Allies, is wearing a German uniform and is pursued by a flotilla of Teutonic bad guys, who battle the Amazons on the beach. The action hops to London and then to the trenches of Belgium, where the War to End All Wars slogs interminably on. There are fistfights in alleys and more extensive episodes of combat, during which Diana makes use of her aunt¡¯s training, traditional Amazon weapons (notably a glowing piece of rope called the Lasso of Truth) and her own unique abilities. She deflects bullets and mortar shells on a sprint across no-man¡¯s land, tosses an armored truck and demolishes a church steeple. Even better, she is a glamorous and funny fish out of water. Diana and Steve are assisted in their mission by a quartet of misfit sidekicks: a Scottish sharpshooter (Ewen Bremner); a Native American scout (Eugene Brave Rock); a Middle Eastern fixer (Said Taghmaoui) and a plucky British suffragist (Lucy Davis). The field of possible supervillains includes Danny Huston as a German commander and Elena Anaya as a diabolical chemist. The great David Thewlis is on hand doing some of the things you might expect and also some things you might not.But make no mistake: This is a star vehicle all the way. Ms. Gadot, who like the other Amazons speaks English with an accent (though hers, unlike Ms. Wright¡¯s or Ms. Nielsen¡¯s, may be a result of her Israeli background), has a regal, effortlessly charismatic screen presence. She and Mr. Pine, who has Paul Newman¡¯s seductive blue eyes and a hint of Clark Gable¡¯s raffish charm, give ¡°Wonder Woman¡± a jolt of classic Hollywood fizz. Their banter, long before that kiss, is lively and sexy, and their oil-and-water temperaments emulsify nicely.Ms. Jenkins and Mr. Heinberg have synthesized a plausible modern archetype out of comic-book and movie sources that may have seemed problematic to modern sensibilities. Diana is erudite but unworldly, witty but never ironic, supremely self-confident and utterly mystified by the modern world. Its capacity for cruelty is a perpetual shock to her, even though she herself is a prodigy of violence. Her sacred duty is to bring peace to the world. Accomplishing it requires a lot of killing, but that¡¯s always the superhero paradox.¡°Wonder Woman,¡± though, resists the reflexive power-worship that drags so many superhero movies ¡ª from the Marvel as well as the DC universes ¡ª into the mire of pseudo-Nietzschean adolescent posturing. Unlike most of her male counterparts, its heroine is not trying to exorcise inner demons or work out messiah issues. She wants to function freely in the world, to help out when needed and to be respected for her abilities. No wonder she encounters so much resistance.",0.965885716410495,"Action"

A cleverly bifurcated tale of two children, it starts in 1977 with Ben (Oakes Fegley), a boy of about 10 in rural Minnesota. He¡¯s in mourning for his mother (Michelle Williams in flashback) and has a question mark ¡ª an absent father ¡ª that needs solving. First, though, there¡¯s David Bowie on the turntable (¡°ground control to Major Tom¡±) and a lightning strike that leaves Ben deaf. Fearless and resourceful, Ben splits for New York to find his father.Ben¡¯s story-twin, whose life and adventures curiously mirror his own, is Rose (Millicent Simmonds, a discovery), a 12-year-old deaf girl in 1927 who yearns to escape her lonely, cosseted life in Hoboken, N.J. To that end, following in the footsteps of countless other dreamers, she, too, flees to New York. There, she seeks out her absent mother, but instead finds a cipher (Julianne Moore), a screen star who clutches fictional babes to her breast but has no time for life¡¯s real lost children. As undaunted and determined as Ben, Rose sets off again, entering a world thrumming with coincidences and complications.Despite the distinct periods and palettes ¡ª Ben¡¯s story unfolds in color, Rose¡¯s in black and white ¡ª the story, the editing and the children¡¯s deafness underscore that these two are deeply connected. The film¡¯s mysteries include how and why they fit, and its satisfactions involve seeing where the scattered bread crumbs lead. How, for instance, an Oscar Wilde line in Ben¡¯s room ¡ª ¡°We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars¡± ¡ª fits into the larger puzzle. And why, after Ben asks his mother about his father, the film shifts to a plaintive Rose, who¡¯s looking at a movie-magazine ad trumpeting ¡°Our Brightest Stars.¡± Both that  Wilde epigram and Rose¡¯s film fandom are hints, clues in a story that eventually dovetails with Mr. Haynes¡¯s interest in images and identity. ¡°Wonderstruck¡± is based on a hefty, generously illustrated children¡¯s book by Brian Selznick, best known for ¡°The Invention of Hugo Cabret.¡± Martin Scorsese turned that book into ¡°Hugo,¡± a reverie about movie love that also features dead parents, a grave if pluckily resourceful child, many whirring yet connected parts and a preoccupation with the cinematic. The film version of ¡°Wonderstruck¡± draws from much the same overflowing treasure-trove of ideas, although Mr. Haynes (like Mr. Scorsese) often feels most energized by the many different ways human beings ¡ª with cinematic sights and sounds, through wall shadows and painstaking miniatures ¡ª put the world in a box. Both Rose and Ben fantasize about escaping their lives, but they need a little push, inspiration. Storytelling lies at the heart of ¡°Wonderstruck¡± ¡ª its two children are effectively writing their way out of one reality and into another ¡ª and the film is chockablock with those boxed worlds, with imitations of life like dioramas, doll-size figurines, stuffed animals, illustrations and an ingenious paper city. Much like the cabinet of curiosities that Rose and Ben each discover, these representations point to new worlds and alternative realities. And, as they pile up, Mr. Haynes joins the story¡¯s halves with craft and wit. Rose¡¯s half isn¡¯t just in black and white, it also emotionally and gesturally recalls a late-period silent film; Ben¡¯s, by contrast, has the rough textures and bleeding colors that summon 1970s big-screen New York.Although the film follows the novel fairly closely ¡ª Mr. Selznick wrote the script ¡ª it nevertheless is very much a Todd Haynes production. Its ideas feel pitched to an older audience, for one, and its emotional temperature is cooler than that of Mr. Selznick¡¯s book, which is soon splashed in tears as Ben¡¯s terror gives way to anguish about his mother. Mr. Haynes is happy to set a wolf after Ben in the woods, a jaggedly shot chase bathed in midnight blue, but he refrains from easy sentimentalism. (The director of photography is Ed Lachman.) As a filmmaker, Mr. Haynes prefers appealing to our heads over tugging at our hearts, and so for a while he keeps you at an intellectual remove.Part of the pleasure of Mr. Haynes¡¯s films ¡ª which include ¡°I¡¯m Not There¡± and ¡°Carol¡± ¡ª is how he deploys intellectual distance as he plays with cinematic form, considers identity and upends clich¨¦s. Elsewhere, this can come across as dreary, even programmatic. Yet because Mr. Haynes also leads with his characters rather than his ideas, his films gather force until, at times with near-violent suddenness, they become devastatingly, skin-prickingly alive. In Mr. Haynes¡¯s ¡°Far From Heaven,¡± his combination of playfulness and seriousness translates into a homage to Sirkian melodrama that turns into a thrilling example of the very same. And, in ¡°Wonderstruck,¡± a children¡¯s story about finding your place in the world, in time becomes a Haynesian exploration of identity, desire and imagination.¡°Wonderstruck¡± takes a while to find its groove, but it gets there. Mr. Haynes¡¯s oscillation between the story¡¯s two halves is gracefully handled (the editor is Affonso Gon<U+00E7>alves), but it can create a frustrating sense of narrative interruptus. That¡¯s particularly true because it¡¯s hard not to miss Rose when Ben is onscreen. Part of this has to do with the charming exoticism of her old-time world with its winking artifice and cinematic allusions. Ben¡¯s half has its attractions, including his new pal (Jaden Michael) and the sun-blasted vision of a broiling New York summer. But it¡¯s also the section in which the machinery of Mr. Selznick¡¯s storytelling, with its mysticism and coincidences, creaks the loudest. Mr. Selznick¡¯s emphasis on wonder ¡ª represented by the story¡¯s surfeit of enchantments and the near-miraculously fitted parts ¡ª can feel bullying, as if he were demanding delight instead of earning it. Yet even as he follows Mr. Selznick¡¯s narrative lead, Mr. Haynes quietly and touchingly makes ¡°Wonderstruck¡± his own because the wonder of the film isn¡¯t in its story but in its telling. It¡¯s in the expressive beauty of his images, the expansiveness of his ideas and the way he naturally, generously brings a once-upon-a-time girl and boy to life, allowing them to find themselves ¡ª in their willfulness, their heartbreaks and their imaginings ¡ª so that eventually they can find someone else.",0.99990637695199,"Drama"

By that point, Mitsuha (a girl yearning to leave her small town) and Taki (a boy in Tokyo) have come to know each other as well as two people can. For reasons they don¡¯t understand, each¡¯s consciousness has been temporarily jumping into the other¡¯s physical shell, only to jump back. This happens at night, which means that Mitsuha regularly wakes up in Taki¡¯s body, and he wakes up in hers, a swap that he likes to confirm by fondling his (her) breasts.As caressing goes, it¡¯s about as clean a scene as it gets, partly because Taki is an anime character, which means that there¡¯s a cartoonish quality to how his enormous, jewel-like eyes widen, and how patches of red bloom on his smooth cheeks. He¡¯s embarrassed, and while you may laugh ¡ª in sympathy, in recognition or just because it¡¯s a funny setup ¡ª his familiar anime look, his pert nose and pointy chin, as well as some of his expressions, put distance between you and him. The beauty of ¡°Your Name¡± is that, as in the best animated movies, the thin black lines of the character design invariably dissolve, and all that remains are Taki and Mitsuha, thoroughly mixed-up teenagers.There¡¯s more to their confusion than they can fathom, which is understandable, given the trippy complications conceived by the film¡¯s writer-director, Makoto Shinkai. ¡°Your Name¡± is a body switching story, but it¡¯s also about tradition and impermanence, disasters and destinies. For Mitsuha and Taki, there are other, more immediate concerns, like being profoundly alienated from the body each is actually inhabiting, which, of course, is another way to describe adolescence (and other maladies). The story opens just as Mitsuha awakens ¡ª or, rather, her physical body does ¡ª and a shocked Taki realizes that he¡¯s crossed over an inexplicable rainbow. Meanwhile, back at his home in Tokyo, a horrified Mitsuha, now somehow in this boy¡¯s body, registers that he/she has to use the bathroom. Movies are filled with body snatchers and switchers, some malevolent and others benign, and ranging from science-fiction freakouts to Disney staples like ¡°Freaky Friday,¡± about a girl and a mother swapping bodies and problems. A lot of these stories skew comic (body anxiety can be good for giggles), and they usually involve an outrageous exchange that turns into an exercise in radical empathy: Two people trade places, and each is forced to experience what the other does and feels. In a sense this kind of swap, even at its goofiest, evokes the transporting process of the fictional experience as we ¡ª viewers, readers and gamers ¡ª temporarily inhabit another being¡¯s consciousness. Mr. Shinkai plays with the obvious comedy of Mitsuha and Taki¡¯s surreal changeover, and, as confusion gives way to a realization of what¡¯s happening, they adjust. Mitsuha, delighted to find herself sometimes living in Tokyo, adapts surprisingly well to Taki¡¯s body and, especially, his habit of visiting cafes (where she gorges on sweets, spending his money). There are tricky moments, too, like her unexpected, chaste flirtation with Taki¡¯s female co-worker, who warms to his new ¡°feminine¡± side. Other than Taki¡¯s borrowed breasts (which he continues to enjoy in vaguely onanistic fashion), he mostly goes with the flow when he¡¯s in Mitsuha¡¯s body, sometimes with messy hair and manspreading.It¡¯s thoroughly charming and gently comic and, if Mr. Shinkai finally plays it safe about what it means for an adolescent boy and girl to trade bodies and lightly toy with gender, he complicates the story in other ways. Gradually, elements that at first seem like contextual details ¡ª a Shinto temple; a racing comet; and a traditional sake called kuchikamizake, fermented with the spit of a virgin ¡ª shift from background to foreground, becoming part of the body-switching story. It¡¯s a narrative progression that at certain moments is echoed by the actual animation, as when the smudged, watercolorlike landscapes movingly overwhelm the cartoonish forms of Mitsuha and Taki.By the time these two (and you) have figured out what¡¯s happening, and why, Mr. Shinkai has set another change in motion, and ¡°Your Name¡± has shifted from a comedy of confusion into a deeply moving meditation on nation, history, catastrophe and memory. It¡¯s a touching, soaring switcheroo, one that Mr. Shinkai achieves with help from Masayoshi Tanaka, who did the character design, and Masashi Ando, the animation director and a veteran of Studio Ghibli. ¡°Your Name¡± is being released in the United States in Japanese ¡ª Ryunosuke Kamiki voices Taki; Mone Kamishiraishi voices Mitsuha ¡ª and in an English dub.
